You are building a single-page, dark-theme website for the Eta Chapter of Zeta Psi Fraternity at Yale University.
Everything should feel “fratty” — bold, high-energy, and a little playful — while still looking polished. The palette is #f4b428 (the gold from the attached logo) on near-black (#0a0a0a) backgrounds. Accent grays (#1a1a1a, #2a2a2a) may be used sparingly for depth.

Global requirements
Framework / stack


Use GSAP 3 for all motion.

Load Google Font: Cinzel (headings) & Inter (body).

Layout & navigation

Sticky top nav bar with logo at left (SVG supplied below) and links to sections:
Home · · Brothers ·  · Contact

and at the bottom once you scroll all the way down you will have:
 History · Summer Housing Alumni · Exec Team

Smooth-scroll to anchors; highlight active link on scroll.

GSAP flourishes

Logo pulses on page load (scale 0.8→1 with elastic ease). and the gsap spinning animation.

Section headers slide in from left, 60 px offset, 0.6 s dur.

Image gallery cards tilt on hover (transform: rotateX(4deg) rotateY(-4deg)), returning on mouseleave.

Accessibility & performance


All images lazy-loaded; alt text provided.
