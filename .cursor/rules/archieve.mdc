PREFACE 

This  Biographical  Catalogue  was  projected  both  to  satisfy  a  desire 
which  has  existed  for  many  years  among  members  of  the  Fraternity  and 
to  commemorate  the  semicentennial  of  Zeta  Psi,  the  celebration  of  which 
occurred  on  April  23  and  24, 1897.  The  first  step  was  taken  in  accord- 
ance with  the  action  of  the  convention  held  in  Boston,  under  the  auspices 
of  the  New  England  Association,  on  December  28  and  29, 1892,  when  Bro. 
William  Platt  Pepper,  Sigma '57,  then  Phi  Alpha,  appointed  a  committee 
of  three  to  publish,  preliminary  to  the  catalogue,  a  Zeta  Psi  Directory, 
which  was  issued  within  one  year,  and  which  contained  the  names  and 
addresses  of  all  members  of  the  Fraternity  with  alphabetical  and  geo- 
graphical indexes.  Early  in  1894  a  copy  of  this  directory  was  mailed  to 
every  member  whose  address  was  known,  together  with  a  circular,  ex- 
plaining the  plan  and  scope  of  the  catalogue,  and  a  biographical  blank 
which  the  committee  requested  each  one  to  fill  out  and  return  promptly 
to  the  secretary.  It  was  hoped  that  members  of  the  Fraternity  would 
immediately  respond  to  this  request  so  that  the  data  thus  furnished  could 
be  classified  and  the  catalogue  published  by  1897.  Many  replied  at  once 
and  have  cordially  supported  the  enterprise  but  the  delays  and  forgetful- 
ness  of  others,  in  addition  to  augmenting  the  amount  and  the  cost  of  the 
work,  have  caused  the  postponement  of  publication  until  1899. 

The  committee  are  much  indebted  for  information  to  the  officers  of 
colleges  where  chapters  are  now  inactive,  viz:  Princeton,  Harvard,  Dick- 
inson, Dartmouth,  Union,  Amherst,  Rensselaer,  Pennsylvania  College 
and  Syracuse;  and  to  Prof.  Libbey  for  pictures  of  Princeton  buildings; 
they  acknowledge  their  obligation  in  various  ways  during  the  progress 
of  the  work  to  many  brothers  who  have  rendered  valuable  assistance  and 
suggestions  without  which  this  Catalogue  could  not  have  been  made 
what  it  is,  to  Brothers  W.  H.  Carter,  G.  S.  Woodhull,  E.  J.  Peck,  J.  H. 
Hopkins,  "W.  H.  McElroy,  L.  S.  Pilcher,H.  T.  Thomas,  C.  H.  Tillinghaste,

Phelan,  H.  W.  Dunn,  F.  W.  Alden,  O.  B.  Wight,  L.  L.  Reford,  to  Chapter 
Committees  and  to  many  others.  They  have  consulted  old  Zeta  Psi  letters, 
documents  printed  and  manuscript,  minutes,  etc.,  college  catalogues, 
annuals,  class  and  alumni  reports,  etc.,  city  directories,  church  books, 
Board  of  Health  records,  etc. ;  they  have  communicated  with  postmasters, 
curators  of  cemeteries,  surrogates,  relatives  and  friends  of  deceased  or 
missing  brothers,  custodians  of  army  and  navy  records,  and  others;  they 
have  also  made  use  of  all  the  previous  catalogues  which  are  mentioned  in 
the  publications  of  the  Fraternity.  Bro.  William  A.  Hoe,  Jr.,  Phi  '88,  who 
was  the  second  member  of  this  committee  until  his  death  in  1897,  did 
much  work  on  the  directory  of  1893  and  not  a  little  on  the  present  cata- 
logue. Much  lamented  Bro.  Max  Schwerin,  while  in  California  battling 
against  disease,  collected  a  large  amount  of  biographical  material  which 
has  been  introduced  into  biography  and  history. 

Notwithstanding  the  effort  by  a  system  of  abbreviations  which  is 
explained  elsewhere,  to  bring  the  work  within  reasonable  limits  as  to 
size,  the  number  of  pages  exceeds  by  at  least  25  per  cent,  the  largest 
estimate.  The  committee  have  endeavored  to  introduce  an  historical 
sketch  of  and  photo-engravings  relating  to  every  chapter,  active  and  in- 
active, and  biographies  of  all  the  members  living  or  deceased.  The 
general  plan  of  the  illustrations  is  first,  chapter  houses  and  college 
buildings,  then  founders,  charter  members  and  present  members.  The 
committee  have  not  accepted  legends  and  current  reports  but  have  taken 


10  PREFACE 

great  pains  to  verify  statements  and  dates  pertaining  to  the  history  of 
the  Fraternity  and  chapters  and  to  the  biographies.  To  Bro.  Marshall 
S.  Brown,  Epsilon  '92,  who  has  written  the  "History  of  the  Zeta  Psi 
Fraternity, ' '  and  to  the  authors  of  the  several  chapter  histories,  the  com- 
mittee for  themselves  and  for  the  Fraternity  here  acknowledge  great 
obligation  and  express  hearty  thanks. 

The  chapter  histories,  nearly  every  one  of  which  contains  a  sketch 
of  the  college  or  university,  add  interest  to  the  historical  portion  of  the 
catalogue  by  the  variety  in  narrative  and  style.  In  editing  the  histories 
it  has  been  necessary  sometimes  to  abbreviate  them  and  occasionally  to 
omit  details  which  are  of  local  interest.  The  general  plan  of  the  individual 
biography  is:  name,  address,  genealogy,  preparatory  and  college  course, 
degrees,  academic  and  honorary,  college  offices  and  honors,  Fraternity 
record,  membership  in  organizations,  learned  societies,  clubs,  etc., 
military  and  naval  service,  domestic  record,  business  career,  offices  held, 
honorary,  political,  etc.,  and  (if  dead)  date  and  place  of  death.  The 
name  is  classified  alphabetically  under  the  chapter  and  under  the  class 
of  the  university  department  with  which  the  member  was  identified  at 
the  date  of  initiation.  If  the  history  and  the  biographies  of  a  chapter 
are  not  so  complete  as  they  should  be  it  is  not  from  lack  of  repeated  and 
urgent  appeal  on  the  part  of  this  committee.  Data  received  too  late  for 
classification  are  printed  in  the  "addenda." 

The  committee  regret,  notwithstanding  their  endeavors,  that  many 
biographies  and  data  are  incomplete  or  are  altogether  wanting,  and 
that  unavoidable  errors  exist,  but  they  will  be  very  grateful  for  further 
information,  for  corrections  of  errors,  for  the  supply  of  missing  data  and 
particularly  for  additional  facts  in  regard  to  the  founders  of  Zeta  Psi, 
Bros.  J.  B.  Y.  Sommers,  W.  H.  Dayton  and  J.  M.  Skillman,  especially 
if  these  be  sent  promptly  to  the  secretary,  either  to  be  published  in  a 
supplement  in  the  near  future  or  to  be  used  toward  making  the  second 
biographical  catalogue  more  nearly  exact.  Old  documents,  letters, 
committee  reports,  convention  minutes  and  Zeta  Psi  memorabilia  of  any 
kind  or  description  whatsoever,  which  may  seem  inconsequential  and 
which  might  sooner  or  later  be  destroyed,  are  being  collected  and  care- 
fully preserved  in  fireproof  quarters.  These  will  supply  missing  links 
in  history  and  in  biography  and  will  be  of  great  value  and  interest  in 
the  future  to  the  members  of  Zeta  Psi.  This  catalogue  is  not  in  any  sense 
a  commercial  enterprise  but  it  has  been  prepared  and  is  published  solely 
for  the  use  and  benefit  of  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity.  The  undertaking 
has  throughout  been  sustained  and  encouraged  by  the  "Committee  of 
Patriarchs."  Considering  that  delays  have  been  unavoidable,  corre- 
spondence large  and  the  work  gigantic,  the  committee  are  confident  that 
the  Brothers  will  cordially  receive  this  catalogue,  with  its  defects,  and 
will  exercise  broad  charity  toward  the  committee. 

If  this  first  Zeta  Psi  Biographical  Catalogue  shall  serve  to  give  the 
members  of  the  Fraternity  an  idea  of  the  size,  strength  and  influence  of 
Zeta  Psi,  to  revive  the  memories  of  the  pleasantest  associations  and 
experiences  of  college  days,  to  cement  more  firmly  the  close  friend- 
ships formed  in  Tau  Kappa  Phi  and  to  stimulate  constant  endeavor  to 
make  Zeta  Psi  a  still  more  potent  factor  for  the  development  of  all  that  is 
good,  pure  and  noble  in  character  in  the  college  and  in  the  world,  both 
in  private  and  in  public  life— if  the  catalogue  serves  to  do  these  things 
then  will  the  committee  feel  that  their  labors  have  been  amply  requited.

FOUNDERS  OF  THE  ZETA  PSI  FRATERNITY 

JOHN  BRADT  YATES  SOMMERS 

Brother  John  B.  Y.  Sommers,  the  son  of  Rev.  Dr.  Charles  G.  and 
Sarah  L.  (Skelding)  Sommers,  was  born  on  August  15,  1829,  in  New  York 
City,  his  father  being  pastor  of  the  South  Baptist  Church,  at  that  time 
situated  on  Nassau  Street.  His  home  was  at  82  Madison  Street  until  he 
was  twenty-three,  when  the  family  moved  to  the  house  at  17  St.  Mark's 
Place,  where  he  died  on  November  23,  1863.  He  was  buried  in  the 
family  plot  in  Greenwood  Cemetery.  He  entered  New  York  University  in 
the  fall  of  1845,  being  then  a  little  over  sixteen  years  of  age,  and  was 
graduated  at  the  commencement  in  1849.  "The  attractive  graces  which 
distinguished  him  made  him  one  of  the  most  popular  students  in  college, 
and  won  for  him  many  friends."  Soon  after  having  been  graduated, 
Bro.  Sommers  entered  as  a  student  the  law  office  of  Kirkland  &  Birdseye. 
In  1854  he  was  admitted  to  the  bar  and  shortly  afterward  was  made  a 
member  of  the  firm  which,  by  the  retirement  of  Mr.  Kirkland  and  the 
promotion  of  Mr.  Birdseye  to  the  bench,  eventually  became  Sommers  & 
Johnson.  Bro.  Sommers  was  married  on  October  5,  1859,  to  Miss  Emma 
A.  Heath,  now  Mrs.  John  L.  Morris,  residing  at  Ithaca,  N.  Y.  Their 
two  sons,  Frederick  Skelding  and  Henry  Cantine  Sommers,  are  resi- 
dents of  New  York  City. 

Early  in  his  course,  perhaps  while  a  freshman,  certainly  in  his 
sophomore  year,  he  conceived  the  plan  of  organizing  a  new  fraternity 
qualification  for  membership  in  which  should  be  good  fellowship,  good 
morals  and  fine  personal  qualities.  He  had  to  consider  that  there 
were  already  chapters  of  three  strong  fraternities  in  New  York  Uni- 
versit}*  and  chapters  of  these  or  similar  fraternities  in  other  colleges 
which  might  be  regarded  good  fields  in  which  to  establish  a  new  one, 
and  that  the  authorities  of  some  colleges  absolutely  prohibited  uniting 
with  fraternities  under  penalty  of  expulsion.  Brother  Sommers,  nothing 
daunted  by  these  conditions,  enlisted  with  him  in  his  new  enterprise  his 
intimate  friend,  William  Henry  Dayton,  and  his  classmate,  John  M. 
Skillman.  Dayton,  on  account  of  ill-health,  went  South  and  entered  the 
University  of  North  Carolina.  These  three  young  men  discussed  their 
plans  at  Sommers'  home  and  by  correspondence.  Dayton  was  to  form  a 
colony  in  his  college  but  his  constantly  increasing  weakness  and  subse- 
quent death  prevented  the  introduction  of  the  new  fraternity.  This 
misfortune  increased  the  difficulties  which  young  Sommers  encountered 
but  with  courage  he  and  Skillman  persisted  in  their  plans,  for  it  was 
said  of  Sommers,  "In  him  were  combined  childlike  simplicity  and  gen- 
tleness of  character  with  the  sternest  inflexibility  of  purpose."  The 
date  of  the  formal  establishment  of  Zeta  Psi  was  June  1,  1847.  Bro. 
William  H.  Carter,  writing  in  1897,  says:  "The  brothers  of  to-day  can 
form  but  little  idea  of  the  anxieties  and  difficulties  which  surrounded  us. 
It  must  have  been  the  charm  of  Jack  Sommers'  personal  manner 
which  induced  me  to  join  on  November  6,  1847,  for  there  had  been  only 
two  initiations  since  the  organization  and  there  were  but  four  members." 

As  to  active  work  in  propagating  the  Fraternity,  he  took  part  in  the 
establishment  of  the  Zeta,  Delta  and  Sigma  Chapters.  "Bro.  Sommers 
is  semper  paratus  and  true  to  Zeta  Psi,"  said  Brother  Rousse.  He 
held  the  highest  office  in  the  chapter,  and  was  secretary  of  the  first  con- 
vention at  Williamstown  in  1849  and  president  of  the  two  conventions  at 
Newburgh  in  1850  and  New  Brunswick  in  1851.  His  character  and 
qualities  of  mind  and  heart,  as  well  as  his  professional  career,  are  best 
described  by  extracts  from  letters  concerning  him  from  those  most 


14  FOUNDERS 

intimate  and  from  addresses  delivered  at  the  time  of  his  death.  One 
wrote,  "I  could  fill  much  space  in  reference  to  his  noble  qualities,  his 
great  intellectual  powers,  his  wonderful  gifts  of  social  adaptability, 
great  kindness  of  heart,  extremely  refined  nature  and  courtly  manners. 
He  was  a  true  type  of  the  old-school  gentleman.  *  *  *  He  was  especially 
noted  for  his  innate  refinement  and  delicacy.  Anything  in  the  least 
coarse  was  absolutely  repugnant  to  him." 

One  Brother  who  knew  him  well  and  delivered  at  a  Phi  Chapter 
meeting  the  eulogy  at  the  time  of  his  death,  remarks,  "The  one  thing 
that  I  should  say  first  about  Bro.  Sommers  is  that  he  was  always,  at  all 
times  and  under  all  circumstances,  a  gentleman.  *  *  *  As  long  as 
he  lived  he  took  a  great  interest  in  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity  and  no  little 
pride  in  the  success  of  the  institution  of  which  he  was  the  chief  founder. " 

Bro.  Sommers  was  a  prominent  Mason.  His  affiliations  at  the  time 
of  his  death  were  with  Adelphic  Lodge  No.  348,  Past  Master;  with 
Adelphic  Chapter  No.  158,  Past  High  Priest;  with  Morton  Commandery 
No.  4,  Past  Eminent  Commander,  and  with  New  York  Grand  Lodge  of 
Perfection  No.  1,  New  York  Council  of  Princes  of  Jerusalem,  and  Zeal 
and  Constancy  Chapter  Rose  Cross,  subordinate  to  the  Supreme  Council 
for  the  Northern  jurisdiction,  whose  Grand  East  is  at  Boston. 

The  Grand  Master  of  Masons  in  the  State  of  New  York  wrote : 
"His  fine  intellect,  his  scholarly  attainments,  his  professional  ability, 
his  courteous  manners,  his  umblemished  life  and  his  zeal  in  every  cause 
for  intellectual  and  social  advancement  were  elements  of  his  character 
which  endeared  him  to  all  who  knew  him — and  by  his  death  I  feel  that 
I  have  lost  a  cherished  friend,  a  wise  and  upright  counsellor  and  an  able 
and  faithful  deputy."  In  reporting  his  death  to  the  Grand  Lodge,  he 
said,  "He  was  of  a  singularly  amiable  disposition.  Acquaintance  with 
him  was  but  the  precursor  of  admiration  for  his  noble  qualities  and 
of  warm  and  lasting  friendship  for  so  true  a  man — exemplary  in  all  the 
relations  of  life,  generous,  gentle  and  altogether  unselfish." 

Following  are  extracts  from  addresses  made  by  prominent  Masons: 

"Our  deceased  Brother  was  by  profession  a  lawyer,  one  of  the  well- 
known  firm  of  Sommers  &  Johnson,  of  this  city.  His  professional  inter- 
course with  his  brethren  of  the  bar  was  marked  by  courtesy  and 
urbanity  and  characterized  by  uprightness.  *  *  *  He  was  not  actuated 
by  a  desire  to  do  the  best  for  his  client  at  all  hazards  but  to  do  the  best 
that  he  could  with  a  due  regard  to  the  rights  and  equitable  interests  of 
those  who  stood  in  an  antagonistic  position,  thus  showing  a  character- 
istic without  which  no  man  can  be  a  great  lawyer — the  love  of  justice. 
His  mind  had  been  carefully  cultivated,  but  his  excessive  modesty  veiled 
to  some  extent  the  richness  of  his  intellect.  *  *  *  In  his  decease  the 
Masonic  Fraternity  has  met  with  a  very  great  loss,  and  had  he  lived  he 
would  doubtless,  and  at  a  proper  time,  have  received  the  highest  honors 
that  the  craft  could  confer  upon  him." 

"Our  late  R.  W.  Brother,  whose  many  virtues  endeared  him  to  the 
craft,  and  than  whom  none  was  more  respected  in  every  walk  of  life, 
had  for  some  time  previous  to  his  death  been  an  invalid.  It  was  fondly 
hoped  that  a  vo3Tage  to  Europe  would  prove  beneficial  and  prolong  his 
life  for  years  of  future  usefulness  and  more  extended  Masonic  honors  for 
which  his  eminent  qualifications  so  highly  fitted  him." 

The  Phi  Chapter  of  Zeta  Psi  attended  the  funeral  of  Bro.  Sommers 
and  at  a  meeting  held  subsequently  adopted  this  minute: 

"The  whole  Fraternity  of  Zeta  Psi  is  called  upon  to  mourn  the  un- 
timely decease  of  Bro.  J.  B.  Yates  Sommers,  the  honored  and  respected 
founder  of  our  order  which  he  continued  to  love  and  adorn  to  the  day  of

us  of  this  revered  patriarch  of  our  Fraternity.  While  grieving  for  our 
own  loss  we  tender  our  heartfelt  sympathies  to  that  other  circle  to  which 
our  departed  Brother  was  bound  by  the  fondest  of  earthly  ties.  As  a  faint 
expression  of  our  deep  regret  we  will  observe  the  ritual  of  mourning, 
drape  our  hall  and  shroud  our  badges  in  the  usual  manner  and  request 
all  our  sister  chapters  to  unite  with  us  in  this  tribute  of  respect.

The  picture  of  Bro.  Sommers  in  this  book  is  reproduced  from  an 
india-ink  photograph  taken  by  Fredricks,  New  York,  in  1859,  which 
was  presented  by  Bro.  Richard  S.  Amerman,  '50,  to  the  Phi  Chapter 
on  May  3,  1894,  at  a  meeting  held,  by  permission  of  the  Chancellor,  in 
the  Council  Room  of  the  old  New  York  University  Building,  immediately 
before  it  was  torn  down.  The  picture  of  his  home  in  Madison  Street 
was  taken  by  Bro.  H.  H.  Watson,  Phi,  1900. 

Although  Bro.  J.  B.  Y.  Sommers  died  when  he  was  a  few  months 
over  thirty-four  years  old  he  had  lived  long  enough  to  see  his  ideals 
realized  and  Zeta  Psi  well  established  with  sixteen  nourishing  chap- 
ters, already  holding  front  rank  in  as  many  of  the  leading  colleges. 
"He  builded  better  than  he  knew." 


WILLIAM^HENRY  DAYTON 

One  of  the  two  whom  Bro.  J.  B.  Y.  Sommers  associated  with  himself 
in  establishing  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity  was  Bro.  William  Henry  Day- 
ton. He  died  on  August  17,  1847,  and  before  any  accessions  were  made 
to  the  chapter.  It  is  necessary  to  make  up  this  sketch  from  the  minutes 
of  the  Phi  Chapter,  which  alone  contain  all  that  is  definitely  known 
regarding  Bro.  Dayton.  The  items  are  quoted  in  the  order  of  sequence. 

The  first  item  is  an  extract  from  the  first  recorded  minutes  of  the 
Phi  Chapter,  of  a  meeting  held  September  15,  1847,  at  82  Madison  Street, 
Bros.  John  M.  Skillman,  as  President,  and  J.  B.  Y.  Sommers,  as  Sec- 
retary, being  present  as  the  only  two  members  of  the  Fraternity. 

''The  chapter  having  received  notice  of  the  death  of  our  late  Brother, 
William  Henry  Dayton,  of  North  Carolina,  the  motion  was  made, 
seconded  and  adopted  that  the  chapter  wear  crape  for  the  space  of 
fifteen  days  from  the  first  Monday  in  November,  1847. ' ' 

The  second  item  is  what  Bro.  John  M.  Skillman  said  in  his  address 
delivered  on  December  18,  1847,  in  the  Phi  Chapter,  at  the  close 
of  his  term  of  office.  "Bro.  Dayton  was  born  in  this  city  in  the  year 
1827.  When  he  was  at  the  age  of  fifteen,  business  compelled  his  father 
to  remove  the  family  to  Boston,  where  they  have  since  resided.  He  went 
rapidly  through  a  course  of  study  preparatory  to  entering  college  with 
great  creditto  himself.  His  health  began  to  fail  him  and  his  physicians 
advised  his  going  South.  Shortly  after  he  entered  the  University  of  North 
Carolina,  at  Chapel  Hill,  of  which  his  uncle  was  the  honored  and  respected 
President.  During  his  Freshman  year  he  showed  his  superiority  in 
intellectual  pursuit  by  gaining  and  maintaining  a  high  standing  in  his 
class  but  his  excessive  zeal  and  diligence  brought  on  illness  and  he 
was  compelled  to  cease  entirely.  The  aid  of  the  best  physicians  was 
called,  but  in  vain,  and  his  death  ensued.  His  loss  we  shall  never  re- 
cover from.  Death  robbed  us  of  one  of  our  best  and  truest  friends,  and 
although  we  have  taken  the  crape  from  our  badges,  we  will  wear  it  long 
in- our  hearts."

The  third  item  is  a  portion  of  the  eulogium  which  Bro.  J.  B.  Y. 
Sommers,  by  appointment,  delivered  at  a  meeting  of  the  Phi  Chapter,  on 
May  23,  1848.  "I  speak  of  Bro.  Dayton,  a  young  man  of  rare  excellence 
and  promise,  whose  meek,  devout  and  consistent  course  adorned  the 
faith  he  for  so  many  years  professed.  The  influence  he  exerted  and 
the  recollections  he  has  left  in  the  hearts  of  those  who  knew  him  will  form 
a  better  and  more  enduring  memorial  than  any  it  would  be  in  our  power 
to  rear.  His  family  weep  for  an  affectionate  son  and  brother,  the  church 
laments  a  beloved  member  in  the  meek  lustre  of  whose  graces  they  had  re- 
joiced, a  large  circle  of  kindred  and  friends  (among  whom  he  delighted 
to  consider  his  Zeta  Psi  brethren)  unite  in  deploring  the  untimely 
death  of  one  universally  esteemed  and  beloved.  Our  Brother  was  a 
son  of  Thomas  Dayton,  Esq.,  formerly  a  resident  of  this  city  but 
who  for  some  years  past  has  resided  in  Boston.  At  an  early  age  he  showed 
promise  of  great  intellect  and  steadfast  endurance,  so  much  so  as  to 
induce  his  father  to  give  him  a  college  education.  After  having  been 
pronounced  eligible  for  admission  into  one  of  our  Eastern  colleges, 
his  physician  suddenly  announced  the  startling  fact  that  consumption 
had  set  its  fatal  signet  on  his  brow.  He  passed  through  the  freshman 
year  at  the  University  of  North  Carolina,  whither  the  advice  of  his 
physicians  had  sent  him,  with  honor  to  himself  and  the  college,  but  he 
was  arrested  by  the  hand  of  death  while  returning  from  a  visit  to  his 
family.  His  willingness  to  labor  for  others,  his  uniformity  of  character 
and  disposition,  meek  lustre  of  a  piety  that  neither  blazed  ostentatiously 
at  one  time  nor  wavered  and  sunk  at  another,  but  shone  serenely  and 
steadily  on,  made  him  deservedly  the  favorite  of  all  who  knew  him. 
His  last  moments  were  as  a  child  sinks  into  slumber  pillowed  on  a 
mother's  breast.  Such  was  the  peaceful  dismissal  of  our  brother.  The 
silver  cord  was  loosed  as  by  the  gentle  untwining  of  its  strands  and 
the  wheels  of  life  stood  at  last  motionless." 


JOHN  MOON  SKILLMAN 

The  son  of  John  and  Catharine  (Newberry)  Skillman,  Bro.  John  Moon 
Skillman  was  born  at  74  Remsen  Street,  Brooklyn,  N.  Y. ,  on  March 
29,  1831.  After  preparing  for  college  in  a  private  school  in  Brooklyn  he 
entered  New  York  University  in  the  fall  of  1845.  As  mentioned  else- 
where, Bro.  J.  B.  Y.  Sommers  interested  him  and  Bro.  W.  H.  Dayton  in 
the  establishment  of  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity,  of  the  first  chapter  of 
which  he  was  the  first  presiding  officer. 

He  was  graduated  from  the  University  in  1849  with  the  degree  of 
A.  B.  After  leaving  college  he  was  in  the  office  of  John  B.  Kitching  & 
Co.  for  a  while  and  then  took  a  business  position  in  the  South.  Before 
the  breaking  out  of  the  Civil  War  he  returned  North  and  entered  the 
naval  service  as  pay  clerk,  from  August  26,  1861,  to  October  15,  1862,  on 
the  U.  S.  S.  "Potomac,"  and  as  acting  assistant  paymaster  and  cap- 
tain's clerk  from  November  14,  1862,  to  February  12,  1864,  on  U.  S.  S. 
"Bohio,"  and  then  on  the  U.  S.  S.  "Meteor"  until  July  13,  1865,  when 
he  died  in  Mobile  Bay.  His  body  was  buried  in  Greenwood  Cemetery. 

In  a  letter  concerning  him  his  sister  says:  "He  was  much  esteemed 
by  his  employers  in  the  office  which  he  first  entered  and  was  a  favorite 
with  all  who  knew  him  for  his  loving,  kindly  disposition,  his  great 
thoughtfulness  for  others  and  exceeding  refinement  of  nature.  He  was 
a  member  of  the  First  Dutch  Church  of  Brooklyn  and  much  interested  in 
the  Sunday  School  the  members  of  which  gave  him  a  large  bible  at  the 
time  of  his  leaving  home  for  service  in  the  Union  Navy."

HISTORY  OF  THE  ZETA  PSI  FRATERNITY 

The  third  and  fourth  decades  of  this  century  were  periods  of  won- 
derful development  for  the  American  Republic  and  its  people.  The 
entire  country  was  surcharged  with  vitality  and  its  abounding  and  in- 
tense life  manifested  itself  in  the  marvellous  conquest  of  the  continent 
with  civilization  as  its  most  important  achievement.  But  great  as  this 
task  was  it  did  not  absorb  nor  exhaust  all  the  energies  of  the  American 
people.  Political  parties  took  new  form  and  the  machinery  of  party 
government  was  developed.  Religious  sects  multiplied  and  proselyted 
with  intense  zeal.  New  schools  of  medicine  were  founded  and  gained 
armies  of  followers  who  supported  them  with  most  partisan  fervor. 
Social  organizations  were  started  in  infinite  variety  and  in  great  numbers. 
Every  man  with  an  idea  immediately  tried  to  give  it  concrete  expres- 
sion in  a  practical  form,  by  organization,  and  societies,  whose  basal 
principle  was  loyalty  to  the  idea  upon  which  they  were  founded,  were 
started  throughout  the  length  and  breadth  of  the  land.  But  whether 
the  purpose  was  to  propagate  a  religious  "ism,"  to  teach  a  scientific 
truth  or  to  advance  a  great  moral  reform,  the  machinery  of  organization 
was  introduced  and  fidelity  to  the  cause  was  demanded  and  received. 
It  was  not  an  accident  that  the  great  period  of  the  organization  of  Ameri- 
can college  fraternities  was  coincident  with  the  movement  just  described. 
It  was  part  and  parcel  of  that  movement  and  could  not  have  succeeded 
as  it  did  in  any  other  period  of  our  country's  history. 

College  men  conceived  the  idea  of  the  fraternity  and  proceeded  to 
put  it  into  practice  with  the  energy  and  spirit  characteristic  of  the  age. 
Conditions  were  extremely  favorable  for  the  rapid  extension  of  the  fra- 
ternity idea  and  the  outbreak  of  the  Civil  War  found  most  of  the  stronger 
fraternities  of  the  present  day  vigorous  and  flourishing.  The  fraternity 
system,  thus  thoroughly  in  keeping  with  the  genius  of  the  age,  had 
become  well  established  when  John  Bradt  Yates  Sommers  entered  the 
*University  of  the  City  of  New  York  in  the  fall  of  1845  as  a  member  of 
the  Freshman  class.  The  son  of  a  New  York  clergyman,  the  Rev. 
Charles  G.  Sommers,  D.  D.,  he  was  born  in  New  York  City,  August  15, 
1829,  and  was  hence  barely  sixteen  years  of  age  when  he  entered 
college.  Three  fraternities  were  in  existence  at  New  York  University, 
but  Sommers  declined  to  cast  his  lot  with  any  of  them. 

Sommers,  although  of  a  quiet,  refined  nature,  was  one  who  naturally 
drew  men  toward  him.  Acquaintance  revealed  qualities  of  mind  and 
heart  which  made  his  fellow-students  desirous  of  his  friendship.  Unas- 
suming, but  real  powers  of  leadership  made  followers  and  supporters  of 
the  friends  he  won.  Bro.  George  S.  Woodhull,  Phi  '48,  the  first  Zeta 
Psi  to  be  graduated  from  college,  and  for  many  years  the  intimate 
friend  of  Sommers,  wrote  that  "Bro.  Sommers  had  a  very  pleasant 
address  and  attractive  manner,  and  the  art  of  attaching  to  himself  his 
acquaintances  till  they  became  his  strong  personal  friends."  His  cul- 
tured, gentlemanly  bearing,  his  energy  and  force  of  character  and  his 
personal  magnetism  fitted  him  preeminently  for  the  work  which, 
although  yet  a  boy  not  quite  eighteen  years  of  age,  he  was  able  to 
accomplish,  a  work  to  whose  magnitude  and  permanence  this  bio- 
graphical catalogue  bears  convincing  testimony. 

Intimately  associated  with  Sommers  in  the  founding  of  the  Zeta  Psi 
Fraternity  was  William  Henry  Dayton,  who  was  born  in  New  York  City 
in  1827,  the  son  of  Thomas  Dayton,  Esq.  When  young  Dayton  was  sixteen 
years  of  age  his  family  moved  to  Boston  where  he  completed  his  prepara- 
tion for  college  in  the  face  of  the  discouragement  of  increasingly  poor

health.  His  physician  informed  him  that  a  course  at  a  Northern 
college  was  an  impossibility  for  him,  and  by  the  order  of  his  physician 
he  went  South  and  entered  the  University  of  North  Carolina  in  the  fall 
of  1846,  where  he  remained  during  his  Freshman  year.  He  returned 
North  in  the  summer  of  1847  for  a  visit  to  his  family,  and  died  of  con- 
sumption, on  the  17th  of  August,  1847,  while  on  the  return  journey  to 
Chapel  Hill. 

Sommers  and  Dayton  were  warm  friends  and  together  they  con- 
ceived the  idea  of  a  new  college  fraternity  which  was  to  start  with  two 
chapters,  one  at  New  York  University  and  the  other  at  the  University  of 
North  Carolina.  These  two  young  men  joined  to  themselves  a  third, 
John  M.  Skillman,  and  with  him  became  the  founders  of  the  Fraternity. 
The  exact  date  of  this  agreement  of  Sommers,  Dayton  and  Skillman 
to  found  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity  has  been  a  matter  of  much  discussion. 
Down  to  1883,  the  date  1847  seems  to  have  been  the  accepted  one  for  the 
3rear  of  foundation,  but  in  1883  the  Grand  Chapter  Convention,  on  the 
report  of  Bro.  Aubrey,  Delta  Alpha,  and  of  a  committee  appointed  to 
investigate  the  subject,  voted  to  accept  1846  in  place  of  1847  as  the 
true  date  of  the  founding  of  the  Fraternity.  Accordingly,  1846  was  used 
until  researches,  undertaken  in  view  of  the  approaching  semicentennial 
of  the  fraternity,  seemed  to  cast  doubt  upon  the  correctness  of  this 
position,  and  in  a  paper  read  before  the  semicentennial  convention  the 
author  of  this  history  maintained  that  June  1,  1847,  was  the  correct  date 
of  the  founding  of  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity. 

Since  1897  two  very  valuable  sources  for  the  early  history  of  the 
Fraternity  have  been  found,  although  they  had  been  missing  for  over  a 
generation;  these  were  the  original  pledge  book  and  the  original  record 
of  minutes  of  the  Phi  Chapter  at  New  York  University.  In  addition  to 
these  invaluable  documents,  many  others,  including  early  minutes  of 
other  chapters,  chapter  correspondence  and  letters  of  the  early  members, 
have  been  discovered  by  the  Fraternity  archivist,  the  Delta  Alpha,  and 
have  thrown  new  light  upon  the  disputed  date  of  origin. 

Both  June  1,  1846,  and  June  1,  1847,  are  given  in  different  places  in 
the  original  Phi  Chapter  book,  containing  the  chapter  lists,  by  Bro.  Som- 
mers himself  in  his  own  handwriting  and  over  his  own  signature  as  the 
dates  of  the  initiation  of  Dayton,  Skillman  and  himself.  The  very 
source  which  we  might  expect  to  be  conclusive,  being  thus  contradictory, 
we  are  obliged  to  look  elsewhere  for  evidence. 

It  was  the  practice  of  the  active  chapters  in  the  first  few  years  of  the 
Fraternity's  existence  to  send  lists  of  their  members  to  the  other  chapters. 
One  of  these  lists  in  the  archives  of  the  Delta  Chapter  gives  the  date  June 
1,  1846,  but  this  list  is  the  only  one  giving  this  date.  Numerous  lists  are 
in  existence,  all  of  which,  with  the  exception  of  the  one  cited  above,  give 
the  date  June  1,  1847,  or  simply  1847.  One  of  these,  dated  March  24, 
1849,  reads  as  follows : 

"  The  Alpha  of  New  York  to  the  Alpha  of  New  Jersey,  greeting:

l?f  llst  °f  a11  Persons  admitted  to  the  fellowship  of  our  Fraternity  in

T      T,hen0;f~llows  in  a  tabulated  list  the  names  of  those  admitted,  with 

51,  1847,  as  the  date  given  for  the  admission  of  the  founders.     One 

:h  earlier  than  the  date  of  the  above  letter,  on  February  22,  1849,  Bro. 

5  himself  sent  a  similar  list  to  the  Alpha  Chapter  of  Massachu- 

tts    signed  by  himself,  giving  June  1,  1847,  as  the  date  of  his  own 

itiation      In  the  back  of  the  original  Phi  Chapter  minute  book  there 

i  a  list  of  the  chapters  of  the  Fraternity  written,  as  the  internal  evidence

the  Phi  Chapter  at  New  York  University.  The  earliest  catalogue  of 
the  Fraternity,  published  in  1859,  gives  the  date  of  the  installation  of  the 
Phi  Chapter  as  1847.  There  is  in  the  archives  of  the  Delta  Chapter  at 
New  Brunswick,  a  letter,  dated  August  5,  1859,  from  Bro.  Sommers  to 
Bro.  J.  H.  Hopkins,  of  the  Delta  Chapter,  acknowledging  the  receipt  of 
the  catalogue  and  testifying  to  the  correctness  of  the  part  relating  to  the 
Phi  Chapter.  Letters  from  Bros.  Carter,  Woodhull  and  Mott,  all  now 
living,  all  of  whom  joined  the  Fraternity  during  the  year  1847-8,  give  as 
the  recollections  of  these  Brothers,  that  it  was  started  in  the  college  year 
1846-7,  and  Bro.  Mott  is  quite  positive  that  it  was  in  the  spring  of  1847. 
This  evidence  is  sufficiently  conclusive  to  warrant  the  Fraternity  in 
settling  upon  the  year  1847  as  the  year  of  the  foundation  of  Zeta  Psi. 

The  death  of  Bro.  Dayton,  while  on  his  way  to  Chapel  Hill,  to 
continue  as  a  Sophomore  his  course  at  the  University  of  North  Carolina, 
prevented  the  founding  of  a  chapter  of  Zeta  Psi  at  that  University,  and 
not  until  eleven  years  later  did  the  idea  of  Bro.  Dayton  find  fruition  in 
the  establishment  of  the  Upsilon  Chapter  at  Chapel  Hill. 

The  opening  of  New  York  University  in  September,  1847,  found  the 
two  remaining  Brothers  full  of  hope  and  enthusiasm  for  their  project, 
and  in  the  first  meeting  of  the  year  and  the  first  meeting  of  which  the 
minutes  have  been  preserved,  held  September  15,  1847,  at  Bro.  Sommers' 
home,  82  Madison  Street,  New  York,  new  members  were  proposed  and 
the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity  was  fairly  started  on  its  prosperous  and  hon- 
orable career. 

The  name  of  the  Fraternity  and  of  the  chapter  at  New  York  Univer- 
sity and  the  broad  outline  of  organization,  had  been  incorporated  in  a 
constitution  adopted  by  the  three  original  members  in  the  spring  of  1847. 
The  minutes  of  the  chapter  meetings,  which  were  held  regularly  after 
September  15, 1847,  show  great  energy  and  remarkable  success  in  complet- 
ing the  organization  and  in  adding  new  members.  This  success  was  due 
very  largely  to  the  rare  qualities  of  personal  popularity,  genius  for  organ- 
ization and  powers  of  leadership  possessed  by  Bro.  Sommers.  The 
credit  for  placing  the  new  Fraternity  upon  a  sound  basis,  for  laying  down 
the  lines  of  future  growth  and  for  defining  the  principles  which  were  to 
actuate  its  members  in  their  relation  to  each  other  and  to  the  Fraternity, 
belongs  to  Bro.  Sommers.  Great  praise  for  earnest  and  successful  pioneer 
work  for  Zeta  Psi  is  due  Bro.  Geo.  S.  Woodhull,  of  the  class  of  1848,  the 
first  Zeta  Psi  to  be  graduated  from  college,  and  to  Bro.  "Wm.  H.  Carter, 
'50, who  was  initiated  several  months  before  Bro.  Woodhull,  and  hence 
has  the  distinction  of  being  the  oldest  living  member  of  the  Fraternity. 

The  Fraternity  has  never  departed  from  the  basal  principles  laid 
down  by  its  founders.  It  has  demanded  character  and  culture  as  the 
first  requisites  for  membership  in  Zeta  Psi.  Given  character  and  cul- 
ture, good-fellowship  has  been  preferred  to  mere  scholarship,  although 
the  Fraternity  has  always  recognized  that  without  scholarship  the  de- 
sired standing  of  member  and  of  chapter  could  not  be  maintained  in  the 
college.  It  has  been  the  policy  of  the  Fraternity,  inaugurated  by  its 
founders,  never  to  choose  men  as  members  solely  on  account  of  attain- 
ment in  restricted  spheres  of  college  activity.  Scholarship  or  athletic 
ability  alone,  although  highly  prized  when  possessed  by  men  of  char- 
acter and  culture,  were  never  sufficient  qualifications  for  membership. 

Bro.  Sommers  in  his  valedictory  address  on  the  "  Elements  of  a  Good 
Society,"  delivered  on  retiring  from  the  presidency  of  the  Phi  Chapter, 
April  15,  1848,  said  that  there  were  two  necessary  elements  in  a  good 
Fraternity,  viz.:  "An  honorable  reputation,  a  broad,  and  a  self-respect- 
ing character  among  ourselves.  Our  reputation  must  be  obtained  among 
our  fellow  students  in  the  University,  and  there  it  will  depend  on  our 
standing  as  students  and  upon  our  individual  characters.  When  either 
of  these  is  wanting  there  is  a  defect  which  will  hinder  us  from  obtaining 
those  whom  we  should  most  desire  to  call  our  Brothers,  for  no  amount  of 
genius  can  compensate  for  want  of  character. ' ' 


20  ZETA    PSI    FRATERNITY 

Zeta  Psi  is  distinctly  a  social,  not  a  literary  organization,  social 
in  the  broadest  and  best  sense  of  the  word.  The  aim  of  the  Fraternity 
has  been  and  is  to  develop  the  member  as  a  social  being-,  through 
intimate  relations  with  a  limited  number  of  congenial  friends  who  are 
bound  together  in  an  organization  where  loyalty,  truth,  honor  and  fra- 
ternal affection  are  the  guiding  principles.  To  this  end  literary  activity 
is  encouraged  as  a  means,  never  as  an  end  in  itself;  to  this  end  likewise 
all  the  varied  activities  of  college  and  Fraternity  life  are  supported. 
The  Fraternity  never  loses  sight  of  the  fact  that  the  man  is  more  im- 
portant than  the  musician,  the  athlete  or  the  scholar. 

Founded  upon  these  principles,  the  chapter  at  New  York  University 
became  by  the  close  of  its  first  year  a  strong  factor  in  the  Fraternity  life 
of  the  college.  The  founder's  idea  of  the  Fraternity  as  an  affiliated  or- 
ganization found  expression  in  the  establishment  of  a  chapter  at  Williams 
College  in  the  spring  of  1848.  Henry  Silas  Hodges,  a  student  in  the  class 
of  1849  at  Williams  College,  was  a  friend  of  one  of  the  members  of  Zeta 
Psi  at  New  York  University,  Bro.  Geo.  S.  Woodhull,  and  this  connection 
was  used  to  start  a  chapter  of  Zeta  Psi  at  Williams.  Hodges  came  to 
New  York  and  was  initiated  May  11,  1848,  as  a  member  of  the  Zeta  Psi 
Fraternity.  A  petition  from  Bro.  Hodges  and  another  who  had  formerly 
been  a  member  of  Zeta  Psi  at  New  York  University,  for  the  founding  of  a 
chapter  at  Williams  College,  was  received  and  granted  on  May  20,  1848, 
and  at  a  meeting  of  the  parent  chapter  held  May  23,  1848,  the  Alpha  of 
Massachusetts  was  duly  installed  as  the  second  chapter  of  the  Zeta  Psi 
Fraternity.  William  W.  Allen,  '49,  Charles  A.  Stowell,  '49,  and  Samuel 
B.  Sumner,  '49,  were  the  first  initiates  and,  together  with  Bro.  Hodges, 
constituted  the  charter  members  of  the  Alpha  of  Massachusetts.  This 
chapter,  later  known  as  the  Zeta.,  flourished  for  a  short  time,  but  adverse 
conditions  limited  its  life  to  four  years,  and  on  June  22,  1852,  it  gave  up 
its  charter,  to  be  restored  over  twenty-nine  years  later,  Nov.  21,  1881, 
to  the  new  Zeta.,  whose  continued  prosperity  amply  justifies  the  reestab- 
lishment  of  a  chapter  at  Williams.  By  June,  1852,  when  the  old  Zeta 
ceased  to  exist,  the  Fraternity  had  already  grown  so  strong  that  the  loss 
of  its  second  chapter  hardly  affected  its  prosperity,  and  interfered  very 
little,  if  any,  with  its  continued  and  rapid  development. 

Rutgers  was  the  third  college  to  obtain  the  honor  of  the  installation 
of  a  chapter  of  Zeta  Psi.  Judson  H.  Hopkins,  of  the  class  of  1850,  Rut- 
gers College,  was  a  relative  and  a  warm  personal  friend  of  Bro.  Geo.  S. 
Woodhull,  of  New  York  University,  and  was  interested  by  him  in  the  pro- 
ject of  extending  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternit3'  to  Rutgers  College.  Hopkins 
associated  with  himself  John  Hess,  also  of  the  class  of  1850,  who  accom- 
panied him  to  New  York,  where  on  November  24,  1848,  they  were  both 
initiated  into  the  Fraternity  as  members  of  the  Alpha  of  New  York  from 
Rutgers  College.  Two  more  Rutgers  men,  Cortlandt  Van  Wyck,  '50, 
and  a  classmate  were  initiated  in  New  York  as  members  of  the  New 
York  University  Chapter.  On  January  15,  1849,  a  petition  from  the  four 
Rutgers  members  was  presented  to  the  Alpha  of  New  York  requesting 
that  a  charter  be  granted  to  the  petitioners  for  a  chapter  of  Zeta  Psi 
at  Rutgers  College.  The  petition  having  been  approved  by  the  Alpha  of 
Massachusetts,  the  charter  was  granted.  Ten  days  later,  Bro.  John 
Hess  was  sent  to  New  York  to  receive  the  charter  and  at  a  meeting 
of  the  Alpha  of  New  York,  held  January  25,  1849,  the  Alpha  Chapter 
of  New  Jersey  was  duly  installed,  Bro.  Hess  serving  as  proxy  for  the 
Rutgers'  petitioners.  The  Rutgers  Chapter  thus  founded  has  had  over 
half  a  century  of  unbroken  history.  The  newly  initiated  members  of 
Zeta  Psi  at  Rutgers  College  were  animated  with  the  true  spirit  of  mis- 
sionary endeavor  for  the  Fraternity  and  Bro.  Peter  W.  Rousse,  '50,  was 
for  several  years  the  self -constituted  head  of  the  ' '  College  of  the  Propa- 
ganda" for  Zeta  Psi. 

The  chapter  at  the  college  of  New  Jersey  at  Princeton  was  the  first 
to  bear  the  second  letter  of  the  Greek  alphabet  as  the  Beta  of  New  Jersey. 


ZETA    PSI    FRATERNITY  21 

Jonathan  Longstreet,  '50,  was  selected  to  act  as  the  originator  of  a 
chapter  of  Zeta  Psi  at  Princeton.  He  was  initiated  as  a  member  of  the 
Rutgers  Chapter  on  May  14,  1850,  and  immediately  started  to  pledge 
men  for  the  proposed  chapter  at  Princeton.  So  successful  was  he  that 
five  men  went  with  him  to  New  Brunswick  and  were  there,  on  June  3, 
1850,  initiated  into  the  fraternal  bondsof  Zeta  Psi  and  withBro.  Longstreet 
were  installed  as  the  Beta  of  New  Jersey.  The  records  and  correspon- 
dence show  that  for  the  space  of  a  quarter  of  a  century  the  existence  and 
organization  of  the  chapter  at  Princeton  were  maintained  in  the  face  of 
much  opposition  and  discouragement.  The  laws  of  the  college  against 
Greek-letter  fraternities  became  so  stringent  that  the  continued  existence 
of  the  chapter,  even  in  secret,  became  unwise,  and  on  account  of  faculty 
action  making  membership  of  the  college  and  of  a  fraternity  at  Princeton 
absolutely  incompatible,  the  chapter  in  December,  1875,  disbanded  as  an 
affiliated  member  of  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity.  The  Grand  Chapter,  how- 
ever, was  loath  to  surrender  such  a  promising  field,  hoping  that  a  reversal 
of  the  attitude  of  the  college  authorities  might  enable  the  Fraternity  to 
continue  at  Princeton,  but  at  the  convention  of  the  Grand  Chapter,  held  in 
Syracuse,  January,  1882,  it  was  voted  that  the  Omicron  Chapter  be  honor- 
ably discontinued  as  an  active  chapter.  This  action  was  rescinded  the 
following  year,  but  the  Philadelphia  convention  of  1892  finally  withdrew 
the  charter. 

The  installation  of  a  chapter  at  the  University  of  Pennsylvania  was 
due  to  the  fact  that  two  members  of  the  class  of  1852,  Edward  W.  and 
Samuel  E.  Appleton,  had  prepared  to  enter  Rutgers  College,  but  had 
changed  their  plans  and  had  entered  the  University  of  Pennsylvania. 
They  continued  the  friendship  formed  in  college  preparation  with  boys 
who  had  entered  Rutgers  and  had  there  become  members  of  Zeta  Psi. 
The  brothers  Appleton  were  induced  to  join  the  Fraternity  and  were 
initiated  at  New  Brunswick,  August,  1850,  in  time  to  return  to  Philadel- 
phia before  college  opened  and  pledge  men  to  become  members  of  a  new 
chapter  at  the  University  of  Pennsylvania.  On  September  4,  1850,  Bro. 
J.  B.  Y.  Sommers,  Phi  Alpha  of  the  Fraternity,  and  Bro.  P.  W.  Rousse, 
'50  (Alpha  of  New  Jersey),  installed  the  new  chapter  at  Philadelphia  as 
the  Alpha  of  Pennsylvania,  with  the  brothers  Appleton  and  four  other 
students,  initiated  the  same  evening,  as  charter  members.  The  Sigma, 
as  their  chapter  was  later  named,  has  for  fifty  years  maintained  un- 
interruptedly its  existence  and  organization  as  the  leading  fraternity  at 
the  University  of  Pennsylvania.  The  semicentennial  will  be  celebrated 
on  March  9  and  10,  1900,  the  convention  of  the  Grand  Chapter.  Zeta  Psi 
is  the  oldest  fraternity  in  continuous  existence  at  the  University. 

Waterville  College,  now  Colby,  was  the  second  New  England 
college  to  possess  a  chapter  of  Zeta  Psi.  Through  the  instrumentality 
of  the  Alpha  of  Massachusetts,  a  local  society  at  Waterville  received 
permission  to  enter  the  brotherhood  of  Zeta  Psi,  and  on  November  19, 
1850,  Bros.  E.  J.  Peck,  Zeta  '51,  and  J.  S.  Barry,  Zeta  '53,  initiated 
fourteen  men  at  Waterville  and  installed  them  as  a  chapter  of  Zeta  Psi, 
the  Alpha  of  Maine.  For  nearly  fifty  years  the  Alpha  of  Maine,  or  as 
it  was  later  called,  the  Chi,  has  sent  out  into  the  world  a  succession  of 
delegations  which  have  ably  represented  the  sterling  manhood  that  con- 
stitutes the  chief  glory  of  Maine.  The  Chi  will  celebrate  the  semicen- 
tennial of  its  foundation  on  June  26,  1900,  with  a  justifiable  pride  in 
its  past  achievements,  and  a  conviction  that  the  secure  basis  of  its  pres- 
ent prosperity  guarantees  continued  success  in  the  second  half-century 
of  its  career. 

The  Alpha  of  Maine,  at  Waterville,  was  the  last  chapter  to  be 
named  under  the  old  system.  At  the  third  Grand  Chapter  Convention, 
held  at  New  Brunswick,  August  6,  1851,  the  present  system  of  desig- 
nating the  chapters  by  letters  of  the  Greek  alphabet,  irrespective  of  the 
States,  was  adopted.  The  Alpha  of  New  York  became  the  Phi,  the 
Alpha  of  Massachusetts  the  Zeta,  the  Alpha  and  Beta  of  New  Jersey 


22  ZETA    PSI    FRATERNITY 

the  Delta  and  Omicron   respectively,    the  Alpha  of  Pennsylvania  the 
Sigma,  and  the  Alpha  of  Maine  the  Chi. 

An  attempt  was  made  to  start  a  chapter  at  the  Theological  Semi- 
nary at  Alexandria,  Virginia,  evidently  in  the  Fall  of  1850,  and  although 
a  charter  was  granted  it  as  the  Alpha  of  Virginia,  the  project  was  not 
a  success  and  on  April  2,  1851,  the  charter  was  resigned.  Bros.  Robert 
E.  Randall,  Sigma  '53,  and  Wm.  F.  Rogers,  Sigma  '55,  were  appointed 
a  committee  to  found  a  chapter  at  Dickinson  College,  Carlisle,  Penn., 
and  on  the  5th  of  March,  1852,  they  successfully  fulfilled  their  commis- 
sion by  initiating  fourteen  men  and  installing  them  as  the  Alpha  Chap- 
ter, which  met  adverse  conditions,  failed  to  conquer  them  and  died  in  a 
little  over  two  years. 

The  Epsilon  Chapter,  at  Brown  University,  was  founded  April 
21,  1852,  through  the  instrumentality  of  Bros.  E.  W.  Appleton,  Sigma 
and  Delta  '52,  and  Peter  W.  Rousse,  Delta  '50,  who  superintended  the 
foundation  of  the  new  chapter  from  Cambridge,  where  he  was 
attending  the  Harvard  Law  School.  John  A.  Gardiner,  '52,  was  the 
leading  spirit  among  the  seven  charter  members,  who,  in  spite  of 
competition  with  five  fraternities,  already  established  at  Brown,  soon 
placed  the  chapter  on  a  secure  footing.  The  Epsilon  Chapter  grew  and 
prospered  until  1861,  when  the  Civil  War  caused  a  period  of  temporary 
depression.  The  following  quotation  from  the  Grand  Chapter  minutes 
of  the  Convention  held  January  2,  1862,  tells  her  glorious  history : 
' '  Especial  remark  was  made  of  the  Epsilon,  every  active  member  of 
which,  with  one  exception,  abandoned  his  studies,  on  the  first  call  of 
the  President,  and  is  at  this  moment  in  the  Army  of  the  Republic." 
A  period  of  prosperity  followed  the  close  of  the  war,  succeeded  in  its 
turn  by  one  of  adversity  which,  in  1876,  brought  to  an  end  the  life 
of  the  old  Epsilon.  Ten  years  later,  April  17,  1886,  the  Epsilon  was 
reestablished  and  speedily  regained  its  old  position  as  one  of  the 
principal  fraternities  at  Brown  and  one  of  the  leading  chapters  of 
Zeta  Psi. 

Not  satisfied  with  the  honor  of  having  established  a  chapter  at 
Brown,  Bro.  Rousse  received  the  requisite  authority  from  the  Fraternity 
and  on  July  12,  1852,  installed  the  Rho  Chapter  at  Harvard  College. 
The  Rho,  after  an  honorable  career,  dating  from  1852  to  1857,  was 
suspended  in  the  latter  year  and  reestablished  in  1865,  was  suspended 
again  in  1867,  and  for  the  second  time  restored  February  17,  1882.  A 
period  of  great  local  prosperity  followed,  but  the  incompatability  of  the 
Harvard  club  system  with  the  interests  of  the  Fraternity  at  large  caused 
the  final  withdrawal  of  the  charter  in  December,  1892. 

The  chapter  at  Dartmouth  College,  the  old  Psi,  was  honored  in  its 
founder,  Nelson  Dingley,  Jr.,  later  Governor  of  Maine  and  for  many 
years  Republican  leader  on  the  floor  of  the  National  House  of  Repre- 
sentatives as  chairman  of  the  Ways  and  Means  Committee.  Bro.  Ding- 
ley  entered  Waterville  College  with  the  class  of  1855,  and  was  there  initi- 
ated into  Zeta  Psi.  He,  however,  transferred  his  academic  allegiance  to 
Dartmouth  College  and  was  thus  the  means  of  introducing  Zeta  Psi  at 
Hanover.  The  chapter,  authorized  by  vote  of  the  Grand  Chapter,  August 
19,  1853,  was  installed  at  Hanover,  by  four  brothers  from  the  Chi.  on  No- 
vember 19,  1853,  in  the  old  Dartmouth  Hotel.  The  Dartmouth  Chapter 
gave  up  its  meetings  in  1865,  was  started  again  in  1871,  but  in  June,  1873, 
its  charter  was  finally  withdrawn. 

The  Kappa  Chapter,  at  Tufts,  was  instituted  October  22,  1855,  by 
members  of  the  Rho  Chapter.  A  slight  irregularity  in  the  initiation  of  the 
movement,  due  perhaps  to  excessive  zeal  on  the  part  of  the  founders,  was 
soon  remedied  and  the  Kappa  has,  during  fort}7-five  years,  chosen  for  its 
members  the  best  men  enrolled  as  students  of  the  "college  on  the  hill." 

Rarely  has  the  prosperity  of  an  institution  been  so  dependent  upon 
the  life  of  one  man  as  was  Union  College  upon  the  life  and  ability  of  its 
great  president,  Eliphalet  Nott.  He  made  Union,  during  the  middle  of 


ZETA    PSI   FRATERNITY  23 

this  century,  one  of  the  greatest  educational  centres  of  the  country. 
Union  became  a  strong  fraternitj'  college  and  it  was  but  natural 
that  Zeta  Psi  should  desire  representation,  although  very  strong  com- 
petition would  inevitably  follow.  On  March  4,  1856,  three  brothers  from 
the  Chi,  duly  authorized  by  the  Grand  Chapter,  initiated  seven  students 
at  Schenectady,  and  installed  them  as  charter  members  of  the  Theta 
Chapter  at  Union  College.  The  chapter  prospered  until  1866,  when  the 
death  of  Dr.  Nott,  after  a  presidency  of  sixty -two  years,  dealt  the  college, 
and  through  it  the  chapter,  a  severe  blow,  from  which  the  college  with 
difficulty,  and  the  chapter  never,  recovered.  It  was  reported  at  the  Grand 
Chapter  Convention  of  1868,  that  the  chapter  had  ceased  to  exist,  owing 
to  the  decline  in  the  prosperity  of  the  college  and  the  consequent  difficulty 
of  obtaining  good  men.  Notwithstanding  this  report,  the  minutes  of  the 
Theta  Chapter  show  that  an  attempt  was  made  to  keep  up  the  organiza- 
tion for  several  years  more,  the  last  member  being  graduated  from 
college  in  1874. 

A  committee  from  the  Sigma  Chapter,  consisting  of  William  Platt 
Pepper,  '57,  and  Henry  Ashurst,  '58,  was  authorized  to  start  a  new 
chapter  of  Zeta  Psi  at  Lafayette  College,  and  on  October  2,  1857,  four 
charter  members  were  duly  installed  at  Easton,  Pa.,  as  the  Tau  Chapter. 
The  Tau,  strong  through  the  support  of  a  body  of  enthusiastic  alumni, 
many  of  whom  live  in  Easton,  has  for  over  forty  years  borne  aloft  the 
white  banner  of  the  Fraternity,  and  at  the  Grand  Chapter  Conven- 
tion, held  in  Easton  in  1898,  gave  conclusive  evidence  of  present  strength 
and  prosperity. 

Brothers  from  the  Epsilon  were  given  permission  to  establish  a 
chapter  at  Amherst  College  in  1858,  but  the  conditions  were  not  favorable, 
and  a  precarious  existence  was  maintained  for  a  year  only. 

The  University  of  North  Carolina,  in  the  decade  preceding  the  Civil 
"War,  was  a  large  and  prosperous  institution,  worthy  in  every  way  to  be 
the  home  of  a  chapter  of  Zeta  Psi.  The  Delta  was  instrumental  in  ob- 
taining a  charter  and  establishing  the  Upsilon  Chapter  at  Chapel  Hill. 
James  Graham  McNab,  '58,  was  sent  North  by  a  band  of  students  at  the 
University  of  North  Carolina  who  wished  to  become  a  chapter  of  Zeta  Psi, 
to  obtain,  if  possible,  a  charter.  Mr.  McNab  was  initiated  at  the  Delta 
Chapter  and  received  full  authority  to  establish  a  chapter  at  the  Univer- 
sity of  North  Carolina,  where  on  the  16th  of  January,  1858,  the  Upsilon 
Chapter  was  inaugurated.  Zeta  Psi  prospered  until  the  Civil  War  de- 
manded the  services  of  faculty  and  students  on  the  fighting  line.  The 
college  was  more  fortunate  than  most  Southern  institutions  and  was 
enabled  to  maintain  the  shadow  of  an  existence  during  the  dark  years 
which  ensued.  The  Upsilon  Chapter  was  also  enabled  to  keep  up  its 
organization,  and  at  the  close  of  the  war  regained  a  good  share  of  its 
earlier  prosperity.  The  sad  days  of  the  reconstruction  period  proved 
more  disastrous  to  this  institution  than  had  the  war  itself,  and  in  1868 
the  University  closed  its  doors,  and  the  chapter  necessarily  became 
extinct.  The  attempt  of  the  Reconstructionists  to  carry  on  affairs,  al- 
though maintained  for  two  years,  was  a  failure.  After  an  interval  of 
about  seven  years,  the  doors  of  the  old  University  were  reopened  under 
the  old  officers;  but  it  was  not  until  ten  years  later  that  the  desire  of 
the  Southern  members  of  Zeta  Psi  for  a  chapter  at  Chapel  Hill  was 
fulfilled.  On  March  12,  1885,  enthusiastic  Alumni,  by  authority  of  the 
Grand  Chapter,  restored  the  Upsilon  to  life  and  to  a  career  of  prosperity 
and  usefulness  which  has  continued  unchecked  up  to  the  present  time. 

The  year  1858  was  memorable  in  the  history  of  the  Fraternity,  not 
only  for  the  founding  of  the  first  chapter  of  Zeta  Psi  south  of  the  Mason  and 
Dixon  line,  but  also  owing  to  its  preemption  for  the  first  time  of  territory 
in  what  was  then  the  West,  beyond  the  Appalachian  range.  Liberty  E. 
Holden  was  the  founder  of  the  Xi  Chapter  at  the  University  of  Michigan. 
He  completed  the  first  two  years  of  his  college  course  at  Waterville  Col- 
lege, where  he  became  a  member  of  the  Chi  Chapter,  and  then  entered 


24  ZETA    PSI   FRATERNITY 

the  University  of  Michigan  in  the  Fall  of  1856  as  a  Junior.  Holden  in- 
duced several  of  his  friends  at  the  University  of  Michigan  to  form  a  local 
organization  with  the  purpose  ultimately  of  becoming  a  chapter  of  Zeta 
Psi.  The  necessary  authority  from  the  Fraternity  was  obtained  through 
the  Chi  Chapter,  and  on  June  21,  1858,  the  chapter  was  installed  with  a 
large  initial  membership.  The  Xi  Chapter  has  experienced  the  vicissi- 
tudes of  fortune  to  which  all  chapters  are  liable;  prosperity  has,  how- 
ever, outrun  adversity,  and  forty-two  years  of  continuous  existence,  during 
which  the  chapter  has  maintained  its  position  as  a  peer  among  the  lead- 
ing fraternities  at  Ann  Arbor,  place  the  Xi  high  in  the  honor  roll  of  the 
chapters  of  Zeta  Psi. 

The  fourth  chapter  in  Pennsylvania,  the  old  Eta,  was  founded  at 
Pennsylvania  College,  Gettysburg,  Pa.,  on  the  13th  of  August,  1861,  by 
a  delegation  from  the  Tau  Chapter.  There  is  an  interesting  entry  in  the 
Grand  Chapter  minutes  of  December,  1863,  which  records  a  resolution 
granting  a  new  charter  to  the  Eta  Chapter  in  place  of  the  one  which  was 
destroyed  at  the  invasion  of  Gettysburg.  The  chapter  lived  through  the 
Civil  War  and  continued  to  initiate  until  1870.  A  committee  appointed 
by  the  Grand  Chapter  in  1873  found  the  chapter  extinct  and  received 
the  charter  and  records  from  their  custodian. 

Two  other  chapters  were  established  during  the  period  of  the  Civil 
War,  the  Omega  at  the  University  of  Chicago,  November  5,  1864,  by 
brothers  from  the  Chi,  Epsilon,  Theta,  Eta  and  Xi,  and  the  Pi  at  the 
Rensselaer  Polytechnic  Institute  at  Troy,  N.  Y. ,  January  31, 1865.  The 
former  shared  the  fortunes  of  the  old  Chicago  University,  and  died  in 
January,  1887;  the  latter,  after  an  honorable  career  of  twenty-eight 
years,  owing  largely  to  a  decrease  in  the  number  of  students  at  the 
Institute,  voluntarily  surrendered  its  charter,  December  21,  1893. 

The  oldest  college  in  Maine  did  not  receive  a  chapter  of  Zeta  Psi 
until  eighteen  years  after  its  younger  sister,  Waterville  College.  George 
L.  Chandler  was  initiated  into  Zeta  Psi  as  a  student  of  the  latter  college 
in  the  class  of  1868,  but  providentially  for  Zeta  Psi,  concluded  to  finish 
his  college  course  at  Bowdoin  College.  Through  his  earnest  efforts  a 
petition  from  the  Chi  Chapter,  for  authority  to  establish  a  chapter  at 
Bowdoin,  was  presented  to  the  Grand  Chapter  and  granted  December  27, 
1867.  The  Lambda,  as  the  Bowdoin  Chapter  was  called,  was  instituted 
by  the  initiation,  on  January  31,  1868,  of  six  charter  members,  in  addi- 
tion to  Bro.  Chandler.  From  1868  to  the  present  day,  the  Lambda  Chap- 
ter has  continuously  maintained  its  position  as  one  of  the  leading  fra- 
ternities at  Bowdoin,  and  has,  like  the  Colby  Chapter,  given  the  best 
from  among  the  sturdy  sons  of  Maine  to  Zeta  Psi. 

The  suspension  of  the  University  of  North  Carolina  in  1868  caused  a 
number  of  its  former  students  to  enter  the  University  of  Virginia  for  the 
completion  of  their  college  course.  Among  them  were  five  brothers 
from  the  Upsilon  Chapter,  who,  on  October  16,  1868,  having  received  the 
necessary  authority,  initiated  four  men,  and  with  them  constituted  the 
charter  members  of  the  Beta  Chapter.  The  Beta  Chapter  was  in  sus- 
pension from  1882  to  March  1,  1893,  when,  owing  very  largely  to  the  en- 
thusiastic endeavors  of  Bro.  R.  T.  W.  Duke,  Jr.,  Beta  '73,  the  chapter 
was  reorganized.  Since  its  reorganization  its  numbers  have  not  been 
large,  but  it  has  obtained  good  men,  and  at  the  present  time  is  in  a  pros- 
perous condition. 

The  auspicious  conditions  under  which  Cornell  University  was  founded 
not  only  drew  students  from  other  colleges,  but  impressed  fraternity  men 
generally  with  the  desirability  of  preempting  the  ground.  Three  active 
members  of  the  Xi  Chapter  at  the  University  of  Michigan  entered  Cor- 
nell in  the  fall  of  1868,  when  its  doors  were  first  opened  for  students, 
and  almost  immediately  associated  four  other  Cornell  students  with  them- 
selves as  petitioners  for  a  charter  from  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity.  Their 
petition  was  granted  by  the  Grand  Chapter  on  December  30,  1868,  and 
on  January  1,  1869,  the  first  initiation  of  the  Psi,  as  the  new  chapter  was 


ZETA    PSI    FRATERNITY  25 

called,  took  place.  The  Psi  has  maintained  a  prominent  position  at 
Cornell,  and  its  elders  have  been  very  influential  in  the  councils  of  the 
Fraternity.  Its  magnificent  chapter  house  at  Ithaca,  completed  in  1892, 
is  one  of  the  finest  fraternity  houses  in  America. 

A  very  important  step  in  the  extension  of  Zeta  Psi  was  taken  at  the 
Philadelphia  Convention  of  December,  1870,  when  authority  for  theestab- 
lishment  of  a  chapter  on  the  Pacific  Coast  was  given  to  the  Grand  Offi- 
cers. Arthur  B.  Waring-,  Phi  '70,  and  Albert  B.  Carlton,  Phi  '72,  were 
instrumental  in  founding  the  Iota  Chapter,  which,  thus  constituted  by 
authority  of  the  Grand  Chapter,  became  Zeta  Psi's  representative  be- 
yond the  Rockies.  Zeta  Psi  was  the  first  of  the  national  secret  Greek- 
letter  fraternities  to  establish  a  chapter  on  the  Pacific  Coast  and 
naturally  reaped  a  great  advantage  from  this  priority,  which  gave  it  a 
leading  position  that  has  been  successfully  maintained  in  the  face  of 
increasing  competition. 

The  fifth  college  in  New  York  State  to  receive  a  Zeta  Psi  charter  was 
Syracuse  University,  where,  on  June  14,  1875,  seven  students  who  had 
been,  on  June  11,  initiated  at  the  Psi  Chapter,  were  installed  as  the 
Gamma  Chapter  of  Zeta  Psi,  representatives  from  the  Psi,  which  had 
been  most  active  in  the  campaign  for  the  new  chapter  and  from  the  Xi, 
assisting.  The  Gamma  had  an  existence  of  twelve  3'ears.  Its  very  weak 
condition  in  January,  1887,  justified  the  Grand  Chapter  in  withdrawing 
its  charter. 

The  prosperity  of  our  Canadian  chapters  and  the  high  standing  in 
the  University  and  social  worlds  which  their  members  sustain  warrant 
us  in  considering  March  27,  1879,  as  a  very  important  date  in  the  history 
of  Zeta  Psi,  for  on  that  day  Zeta  Psi  first  crossed  the  boundaries  of  the 
United  States  and  made  itself  an  international  fraternity  by  establishing 
a  chapter  at  the  University  of  Toronto.  The  Xi  has  the  honor  of  being 
the  mother  chapter  of  the  Theta  Xi ;  nine  members  of  the  former,  assisted 
by  two  from  the  Pi,  under  authority  of  the  Grand  Chapter,  went  to 
Toronto  and  initiated  nine  students  of  the  University  of  Toronto  and 
installed  them  as  the  Theta  Xi  Chapter  of  Zeta  Psi.  Zeta  Psi  was  first 
at  Toronto,  as  she  had  been  on  the  Pacific  Coast,  and  for  thirteen  years 
had  the  field  all  to  herself.  The  best  men  at  the  University  became 
Zetes  and  gave  the  chapter  a  prestige  that  has  been  of  great  value  since 
the  introduction  of  other  fraternities  brought  in  the  element  of  rivalry  for 
possession  of  the  most  desirable  men. 

Columbia  University  always  has  a  number  of  students  from  other 
colleges  pursuing  studies  in  her  several  departments.  In  1879,  Bro. 
Richard  A.  Anthony,  Delta  '81,  found  that  besides  himself  there 
were  brothers  from  four  different  chapters  studying  at  Columbia.  Un- 
der his  leadership  they  petitioned  for  a  chapter  at  Columbia.  The 
petition,  supported  by  a  very  large  number  of  prominent  members  of 
Zeta  Psi  in  New  York  City,  was  granted  by  the  constitutional  authori- 
ties, and  on  December  12,  1879,  Bro.  W.  L.  Otis,  past  Phi  Alpha,  pre- 
sided at  the  installation  of  the  Columbia  or  Mu  Chapter,  a  name  which 
was  changed  two  years  later  to  the  Alpha.  The  Alpha  has  maintained  itself 
since  1879  in  the  face  of  the  most  severe  competition  from  other  strong 
fraternities.  The  removal  of  the  University  to  the  new  site  at  Morning- 
side  Heights  has  created  a  healthier  college  life,  and  the  chapter  hopes 
to  share  with  the  University  in  its  new  era  of  prosperity. 

In  1883  the  Fraternity  for  the  second  time  crossed  into  Canada, 
and  on  January  3d  of  that  year,  founded  the  Alpha  Psi  Chapter  at 
University.  Bro.  D.  J.  G.  Wishart,  Theta  Xi  '83,  after 
graduation  at  Toronto  University,  entered  McGill  University  for  his 
medical  course,  and  with  the  assistance  of  another  graduate  of  the 
University  of  Toronto,  R.  F.  Ruttan,  who  was  also  in  the  Medical 
Department,  selected  seven  other  men,  who,  together  with  themselves, 
petitioned  successfully  for  a  charter  from  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity. 
Bro.  Henry  Brock,  Theta  Xi  '81,  and  Bro.  A.  B.  Cameron,  Theta  Xi 


26  ZETA    PSI    FRATERNITY 

'83,  installed  the  chapter  January  3,  1883.  The  Alpha  Psi  was 
without  a  rival  for  fourteen  years  at  McGill  University,  and  has  had  a 
career  of  great  prosperity.  It  ranks  deservedly  among  the  strong 
chapters  of  the  Fraternity.  The  chapter  has  achieved  the  distinction  of 
combining  supremacy  in  scholarship  with  a  leading  position  in  the 
college  athletic  world.  The  very  large  number  of  winners  of  the  highest 
scholastic  distinctions  and  the  numerous  representation  on  the  Faculty 
of  McGill  attest  the  former,  while  the  extraordinary  number  who  have 
held  official  positions  in  the  athletic  organizations  and  membership  in 
the  athletic  teams  proves  the  latter. 

The  year  following  the  founding  of  the  chapter  at  McGill  Uni- 
versity witnessed  the  establishment  of  the  first  Ohio  Chapter  at  the 
Case  School  of  Applied  Science.  Elders  of  the  Xi  and  of  other  chapters 
residing  in  Cleveland  interested  themselves  in  introducing  a  chapter  of 
Zeta  Psi  at  the  new  technical  school  founded  through  the  liberality  of 
Leonard  Case.  A  charter  was  granted  to  six  undergraduates  in 
October,  1889,  and  on  November  27th  four  of  them  journeyed  to  Ann 
Arbor  and  were  there  initiated  and  installed  as  the  Nu  Chapter  of  the 
Zeta  Psi  Fraternity.  The  Nu  Chapter  has  always  kept  its  numbers 
small,  but  the  presence  in  Cleveland  of  a  large  body  of  influential 
alumni  of  Zeta  Psi  is  an  element  of  strength  which  enables  the  chapter 
to  maintain  a  high  standard  of  qualification  for  membership  and  insures 
continued  prosperity. 

The  wisdom  of  entering  Yale  University,  under  the  peculiar  condi- 
tions of  fraternity  life  existing  there  and  with  the  well-known  Yale  con- 
servatism to  contend  against,  was  questioned  by  many  earnest  members 
of  the  Fraternity,  but  success  has  justified  the  establishment  of  Zeta 
Psi  at  New  Haven.  Bro.  S.  B.  Sumner,  Zeta  '49,  was  deeply  interested 
and  was  ably  assisted  by  Bro.  Walter  G.  Eliot,  Alpha  '78,  in  the  en- 
deavor to  obtain  a  charter.  That  having  been  secured  on  May  11,  1889, 
ten  New  Haven  students  were  initiated  at  the  Zeta  Psi  Club,  in  New 
York  City,  as  the  charter  members  of  the  Eta  Chapter,  Bro.  A.  H.  Gal- 
latin,  Phi  '59,  presiding.  A  chapter  house  was  built  in  1891,  which  in 
1899  was  replaced  by  the  present  stately  structure,  whose  architectural 
beauty  and  whose  adaptability  to  the  needs  of  the  chapter  make  it  one 
of  the  finest  fraternity  houses  in  the  country. 

Zeta  Psi  added  another  to  her  long  list  of  pioneer  chapters  in  1892 
by  crossing  the  Rockies  for  a  second  time  and  placing  a  chapter  at  Palo 
Alto  three  months  after  Stanford  University  had  opened  its  doors  to  stu- 
dents. The  Iota  Chapter  at  Berkeley  was  naturally  desirous,  shut  off  as  it 
was  very  largely  from  fellowship  with  the  Eastern  chapters,  of  placing 
a  branch  of  Zeta  Psi  at  the  new  sister  University  of  the  Pacific  slope, 
and,  under  the  leadership  of  Bro.  Edwin  Mays,  Iota '93,  secured  the  con- 
sent of  the  Grand  Chapter  at  Philadelphia  January  9,  1892,  when  a 
charter  was  granted  to  the  petitioners,  a  number  of  whom  had  already 
become  members  of  the  Fraternity  at  the  Iota  Chapter.  The  two  Pacific 
chapters  have  proved  a  source  of  mutual  strength,  and  the  Mu  has  had 
an  extremely  creditable,  although  a  short,  history,  and  will  unquestion- 
ably maintain  at  Palo  Alto  the  same  relative  position  which  the  Iota  has 
secured  at  Berkeley. 

If  perseverance  deserves  success  the  youngest  chapter  of  the  Fra- 
ternity merits  the  membership  in  Zeta  Psi  it  so  long  coveted.  An 
organization  of  students  at  the  University  of  Minnesota  was,  for  six 
long  years,  unremitting  in  its  efforts  to  obtain  a  charter  from  Zeta  Psi. 
The  traditional  and  wise  conservatism  of  the  Grand  Chapter  and  the  diffi  - 
cultiesof  complyingwiththeexactingconditionsof  admission,  were  finally 
overcome,  and  on  August  26,  1899,  ten  men  were  initiated  and  installed 
as  the  Alpha  Beta  Chapter  of  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity  by  a  committee  of 
Grand  Officers  consisting  of  Bros.  Kenneth  Cameron,  Alpha  Phi  '87, 
Phi  Alpha;  Pomeroy  Ladue,  Xi  '90,  Alpha  Sigma  Alpha;  Albert  Buch- 
man,  Psi  '77,  Gamma  Alpha,  and  Israel  C.  Pierson,  Phi  '65,  Delta 


ZETA  PSI  FRATERNITY  27 

Alpha,  assisted  by  a  large  number  of  elders,  resident  in  Minneapolis 
and  St.  Paul.  A  chapter  house  had  already  been  purchased  and  the 
latest  addition  to  the  chapter  roll  of  Zeta  Psi  begins  its  career  under  the 
most  auspicious  conditions. 

Local  conditions  very  largely  determine  the  peculiar  form  that  chapter 
life  takes  at  the  several  colleges,  but  the  chapter  house  idea  has  been 
steadily  gaining  ground.  Sixteen  of  the  twenty-one  active  chapters  have 
chapter  houses;  ten  of  these  are  owned  by  the  fraternity  and  six  are 
leased.  The  Eta  Chapter,  at  Yale,  conforms  to  the  local  custom  and 
has  no  dormitories,  while  each  of  the  other  chapter  houses  is  not  only  the 
home  of  the  chapter  but  also  the  college  home  of  a  number,  generally  a 
majority,  of  the  active  members  of  the  chapter.  The  chapters  at  Wil- 
liams, Rutgers,  Pennsylvania,  Tufts,  North  Carolina,  Michigan,  Cornell, 
California,  Yale  and  Minnesota  own  their  houses,  while  those  at  New 
York,  Virginia,  Toronto,  Columbia,  Case  School  and  Stanford  lease 
chapter  houses.  The  other  chapters  lease  suites  of  rooms  for  the  general 
use  of  the  chapter. 

Thus  Zeta  Psi  has  grown  from  the  little  band  of  founders  to  its  pres- 
ent magnitude.  The  three  have  become  about  five  thousand  and  fifty. 
The  parent  chapter  at  New  York  University  has  now  associated  with 
herself  in  filial  and,  at  the  same  time,  fraternal  fellowship,  like  chap- 
ters from  Maine  to  California  and  from  the  Canadas  to  the  Carolinas. 
The  history  of  the  growth,  which  has  been  traced,  shows  that  certain 
periods  have  been  productive  of  greater  external  development  than  others 
and  that  dominating  personalities  have  appeared  from  time  to  time  to 
guide  the  progress  and  control  the  interests  of  the  Fraternity.  The  first 
period  may  be  said  to  extend  from  1847  to  1852,  a  period  during  which 
the  founders  themselves  retained  an  active  interest  and  oversight  in  the 
affairs  of  the  Fraternity.  At  the  close  of  its  first  five  years  of  life  Zeta 
Psi  had  nine  chapters  in  the  older  Eastern  colleges.  The  surviving 
founder,  Bro.  Sommers,  was  ably  supported  by  Bros.  Geo.  S.  Woodhull, 
Phi  '48,  whose  character,  ability  and  zeal  did  much  to  make  secure  the 
foundation  already  laid.  But  it  is  Bro.  Peter  W.  Rousse,  Delta  '50,  to 
whom,  after  the  founders  themselves,  the  chief  credit  is  due  for  the  rapid 
extension  of  the  Fraternity  during  this  first  period. 

The  next  period  of  marked  growth  was  from  1855  to  1858,  when  six 
new  chapters  were  started.  The  admission  of  chapters  in  the  West  and 
South  in  1858  made  the  Fraternity  a  national  and  no  longer  a  purely 
Eastern  organization.  During  this  period  Bro.  G.  L.  Bennett,  Rho  '54, 
was  the  most  energetic  leader  in  Zeta  Psi  activities,  and  the  Fraternity 
owes  much  to  the  painstaking  and  laborious  manner  in  which  he  devoted 
himself  to  its  interests. 

The  period  of  the  Civil  War  was  of  necessity  one  during  which  little 
progress  was  made, — the  nation  demanded  its  young  manhood  and  Zeta 
Psi,  composed  of  the  flower  of  the  youth  of  the  country,  gave  and  gave 
most  liberally  of  its  best  for  the  defense  of  the  Union.  The  loss  of  so 
many  active  members  was  a  serious  blow  to  the  Fraternity,  from  which, 
however,  it  recovered  with  surprising  ease,  the  later  years  of  the  war 
being  a  time  of  very  considerable  prosperity  and  activity. 

The  majority  of  the  members  of  the  Fraternity  were  Unionists  yet 
the  Southern  members,  although  shut  off  by  the  exigencies  of  war  from 
all  communication  with  their  Northern  brethren,  were  still  regarded  as 
members  and  it  is  a  remarkable  tribute  to  the  strength  of  the  bond  which 
unites  us,  that  in  July,  1862,  when  war  passions  were  at  fever  heat,  when 
ecclesiastical  and  social  organizations  had  divided  North  and  South,  the 
Grand  Chapter  of  Zeta  Psi,  in  convention  assembled,  could  have  passed 
and  did  pass  the  following  resolutions  presented  by  Bro.  "W.  H.  Cooke, 
Phi  '58.  The  first  two  resolutions  evinced  the  loyalty  of  the  Fraternity 
to  the  cause  of  the  Republic,  but  the  last  resolution  "refers  particularly 
to  the  Southern  members,  and  shows  the  enduring  nature  of  Zeta  Psi's 
fellowship : 


28  ZETA   PSI  FRATERNITY 

"  Resolved,  That  we,  the  brethren  of  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity,  al- 
though recognizing'  only  the  bond  of  our  motto,  T  K  3>,  yet  viewing-  the 
terrible  calamity  in  which  our  country  is  involved,  hail  with  pride  that 
true  patriotic  spirit  which  has  actuated  our  brethren  in  so  nobly  respond- 
ing to  the  call  of  our  common  Republic.  God  speed  our  noble  brethren 
in  their  offering;  brethren  by  the  ties  of  country,  brethren  still  more  by 
the  closer  ties  of  our  loved  Fraternity.  We  honor  them,  but  still  more  do 
they  honor  us. 

Resolved,  That,  while  we  rejoice  over  our  living  heroes,  we  can  but 
mourn  the  loss  of  those  who,  falling  in  defense  of  established  principles, 
have  enrolled  their  names  among  the  sainted  heroes  of  the  past.  Gone, 
but  not  lost;  silent,  yet  speaking  continually  to  our  hearts;  dead,  yet 
immortal." 

'•'•Resolved,  That  while  we  may  differ  in  political  sentiment  with 
those  of  our  brethren  who  are  courageously  battling  for  principles  which 
they  deem  right,  no  disaster  shall  separate  them  from  the  communion  of 
Tau  Kappa  Phi." 

The  Upsilon  Chapter,  at  the  University  of  North  Carolina,  was 
represented  at  the  first  Convention  held  after  the  close  of  the  war  in 
December,  1865,  and  its  delegate  was  welcomed  by  the  Grand  Chapter 
with  enthusiastic  applause. 

The  Fraternity  shared  with  the  country  the  prosperity  which  followed 
the  end  of  the  great  civil  strife.  Conventions  were  well  attended,  chapters 
were  active  and  chapter  rolls  were  well  filled,  a  number  of  new  chapters 
were  instituted  and  the  faithful  labors  in  the  Grand  Chapter  of  de- 
voted Brothers  were  fruitful  of  good  results.  The  following  Brothers, 
among  others,  contributed  materially  to  the  success  of  Zeta  Psi  during 
this  period  :  Bros.  A.  H.  Gallatin,  Phi  '59,  Samuel  Marsh,  Phi  and  Theta 
'67,  A.  B.  Carlton,  Phi  '72,  W.  H.  Moore,  Epsilon  '67,  and  L.  S.  Pilcher, 
Xi  '62.  From  1869  to  1878,  inclusive,  only  two  chapters  were  added  to 
the  Fraternity,  one  at  California  in  1871,  and  one  at  Syracuse  in  1875, 
not  including  an  attempt  to  establish  a  chapter  at  Annapolis,  in  1874, 
which  was  almost  immediately  given  up  owing  to  the  hostility  of  the 
authorities. 

Again  the  Fraternity  shared  with  the  country  the  reaction  succeeding 
post-bellum  prosperity.  Attendance  at  the  Grand  Chapter  Convention 
fell  off,  and  the  growth  of  the  Fraternity  was  checked  for  a  few  years. 
In  the  last  half  of  the  decade  Zeta  Psi  recovered  from  this  temporary  de- 
pression much  more  rapidly  than  did  the  country  at  large.  Attendance  at 
the  conventions  greatly  increased,  and  much  valuable  work  in  perfecting 
the  central  organization  of  the  Fraternity  was  accomplished.  During  the 
first  part  of  the  eighth  decade  there  was  no  dominating  personality  in 
the  councils  of  the  Fraternity,  but  from  1873,  when  as  an  undergraduate 
he  attended  a  convention  for  the  first  time,  to  his  lamented  death  in  1881, 
Bro.  William  L.  Otis,  Pi  and  Xi  '74,  was  unceasing  in  his  labors  for 
Zeta  Psi.  During  those  years  the  history  of  the  Grand  Chapter  is  largely 
a  history  of  Bro.  Otis's  work  for  the  Fraternity.  He  gave  himself  to  the 
task  of  strengthening  the  Fraternity  and  of  advancing  its  interests  with  a 
zeal,  an  ability  and  a  devotion  of  time  that  entitle  him  to  a  great  debt  of 
gratitude  and  place  him  in  the  very  front  rank  of  the  benefactors  of  Zeta 
Psi.  His  untimely  death  was  an  irreparable  loss  to  the  Fraternity,  whose 
service  was  his  greatest  pleasure. 

The  extension  of  Zeta  Psi  to  Canada  in  1879,  for  the  first  time  ad- 
mitting chapters  outside  the  limits  of  the  United  States,  was  a  most  im- 
portant step  in  the  growth  of  the  Fraternity,  followed,  as  it  was,  by  the 
installation  of  a  chapter  at  McGill  University.  It  made  the  Fraternity, 
in  reality,  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity  of  North  America.  During  the  ninth 
decade  of  this  century,  Charles  B.  Everson,  Psi  '78,  was  one  of  the  most 
active  and  efficient  workers  in  the  Fraternity.  His  valuable  and  long- 
continued  labors  for  the  upbuilding  of  Zeta  Psi  place  him  among  the 
foremost  of  its  supporters. 


ZETA  PSI  FRATERNITY  29 

Since  1883,  conservatism  has  been  the  rule  governing  the  granting  of 
charters  to  new  chapters.  Only  four,  not  including  reestablishments, 
have  been  issued  in  the  last  seventeen  years — at  Case  School  in  1884;  Yale 
in  1889;  Stanford  in  1892,  and  Minnesota  in  1899.  Far  from  being  a  period 
of  stagnation,  however,  the  last  seventeen  years  have  been  years  of  re- 
markable prosperity.  The  Fraternity  has  been  able  as  never  before  to 
command  the  services  of  a  large  number  of  prominent  alumni  in  the 
task  of  administering  the  affairs  of  Zeta  Psi.  A  most  efficient  central 
organization  has  been  perfected  in  the  "Standing  Committee  of  Patri- 
archs," which  was  authorized  at  the  Philadelphia  Convention,  held 
January,  1892.  Probably  no  single  action  since  the  founding  of  the 
Fraternity  has  been  fraught  with  so  much  of  benefit  to  Zeta  Psi  as  the 
organization  of  the  Committee  of  Patriarchs.  The  remarkable  prosper- 
ity of  the  Fraternity  to-day  is  very  largely  due  to  its  wise,  consistent 
policy  and  to  the  devoted  labors  of  its  members,  and  especially  those  of 
the  man  who  has  been  its  chairman  since  1892 — Bro.  I.  C.  Pierson,  Phi 
'65.  Bro.  Pierson  has  given  his  time,  his  energy  and  his  love  in  a  re- 
markable degree  to  Zeta  Psi,  and  it  is  probably  safe  to  say  that  no 
member  of  the  Fraternity  since  its  foundation  has  bestowed  upon  it  so 
much  successful  labor.  The  Fraternity  also  owes  a  debt  of  gratitude  to 
its  efficient  treasurer,  Bro.  Albert  Buchman,  Psi  '79,  who  for  the  past 
ten  years  has  ably  managed  its  financial  interests. 

The  affairs  of  the  Fraternity  at  large  for  the  first  two  years  of  its  exist- 
ence were  controlled  by  the  three  chapters  through  correspondence.  This 
method,  however,  proved  inefficient  and  unsatisfactory.  The  Alpha  of  New 
York  (Phi),  at  a  meeting  held  June  16,  1849,  passed  the  following  minute: 
"The  chapter  then  adopted  the  call  of  the  Alpha  of  Massachusetts  for  a 
convention  of  the  Fraternity,  to  be  held  at  "Williamstown,  on  the  14th  of 
August  next."  Bro.  J.  B.  Y.  Somtners  forwarded  the  action  of  the  chap- 
ter on  the  next  day  to  the  Alpha  of  New  Jersey  (Delta)  in  a  letter,  in 
which  he  stated:  "  You  are  doubtless  aware  that  the  subject  of  a  Con- 
vention has  been  agitated  for  some  time  among  the  chapters,  the  neces- 
sity for  which  is  obvious.  We  have  just  received  communications  from 
the  Alpha  of  Massachusetts  requesting  that  a  Convention  be  held  at 
Williamstown  on  the  14th  of  August  next,  for  the  purpose  of  revising 
Constitution,  By-Laws  and  Ceremonies." 

Pursuant  to  this  call,  the  first  Grand  Chapter  Conventionof  the  Zeta 
Psi  Fraternity  was  held  at  Williamstown,  Mass.,  on  August  14  and  15, 
1849.  Delegates  were  present  from  each  of  the  three  chapters.  Bro. 
Woodhull,  of  the  Alphaof  New  York,  was  elected  President;  Bro.  Stowell, 
of  the  Alpha  of  Massachusetts,  Vice-President,  and  Bro.  Sommers,  of 
the  Alpha  of  New  York,  Secretary.  It  may  be  inferred  from  the  absence 
of  a  treasurer  from  this  list  of  officers  that  money  had  not  as  yet  become 
an  asset  of  the  infant  order.  Three  committees  were  appointed — on  Con- 
stitution and  By-Laws,  on  Initiation  and  on  Signs,  Symbols  and  Cere- 
monies. 

The  second  Convention  was  held  at  Newburgh,  N.  Y.,  August  22, 1850. 
Delegates  were  present  from  New  York  University,  Williams  and  Rutgers. 
A  charter  was  granted  to  the  Alpha  of  Pennsylvania  at  the  University 
of  Pennsylvania  and  delegates  in  waiting  were  immediately  admitted 
from  that  chapter.  The  most  important  work  of  this  Convention  was  the 
adoption  of  a  new  Constitution  of  the  Fraternity,  which  was  presented 
as  a  report  by  the  Committee  on  Constitution  and  By-Laws  appointed  at 
the  first  Convention,  consisting  of  Bros.  Rousse  and  Hess,  of  the  Alpha 
of  Xew  Jersey,  and  Skillman,  of  the  Alpha  of  New  York.  This  Consti- 
tution, with  a  few  amendments,  continued  in  force  until  1862,  when  the 
Convention  held  in  Boston  in  December,  1862,  adopted  a  general  revision 
of  the  Constitution  which  had  been  prepared  by  Bros.  Wm.  H.  Cooke, 
Phi  '60,  and  J.  F.  Dripps,  Phi  '63.  Amendments  were  passed  from 
time  to  time,  but  for  twenty-eight  years  the  Constitution  remained  sub- 
stantially unchanged.  A  second  general  revision  of  the  Constitution  was 


30  ZETA   PSI   FRATERNITY 

adopted  by  the  Grand  Chapter  at  New  York,  January,  1890,  and  the  fol- 
lowing 3^ear  the  same  committee  on  the  revision  of  the  Constitution  re- 
ported a  new  set  of  By-Laws,  which  were  adopted  after  discussion  and 
amendment.  The  work  of  this  committee  was  most  thorough  and  pains- 
taking, and  remains  to-day  a  monument  to  the  wisdom  and  ability  of  the 
framers  of  our  fundamental  laws. 

The  third  convention  was  held  at  New  Brunswick,  N.  J.,  with  the 
Rutgers  Chapter,  August  6,  1851,  after  which,  for  four  successive  years, 
conventions  were  held  respectively  at  Poughkeepsie,  N.  Y.,  Brooklyn,  N. 
Y.,  Springfield,  Mass.,  and  Hartford,  Conn.  Of  the  first  seven  conven- 
tions, two  only  were  held  in  University  towns  but,  beginning  with  the 
session  of  1856,  the  policy  of  the  Grand  Chapter  has  been  to  meet  in 
University  towns  as  the  guest  of  the  local  chapter  or  chapters.  The  only 
exceptions  to  this  rule  have  been  the  conventions  in  Cleveland  in  1877, 
held,  however,  under  the  auspices  of  the  Xi  Chapter  of  the  University 
of  Michigan  in  conjunction  with  the  Cleveland  Alumni;  in  Chicago  in 
1889,  with  the  Northwestern  Metropolitan  Chapter;  in  Boston,  in  Decem- 
ber, 1892,  as  the  guests  of  the  New  England  Association,  and  several 
sessions  held  in  New  York,  with  the  New  York  Alumni  or  the  Committee 
of  Patriarchs. 

The  semicentennial  session  of  the  Grand  Chapter  of  the  Zeta  Psi 
Fraternity,  held  in  New  York  City,  April  23  and  24,  1897,  will  long  be 
remembered  by  every  brother  who  attended,  as  the  most  notable  and 
most  successful  function  ever  held  under  the  auspices  of  Zeta  Psi.  The 
Committee  of  Patriarchs,  assisted  by  a  semicentennial  committee  of 
prominent  elders  from  each  chapter,  carefully  planned  and  carried 
out,  with  conspicuous  success,  the  elaborate  arrangements  which  made 
the  convention  a  worthy  celebration  of  the  Fiftieth  Anniversary  of  the 
Fraternity.  Representatives  from  twenty-four  chapters  signed  the  con- 
vention register  and  over  three  hundred  members  were  in  attendance. 
Bro.  Wm.  H.  Carter,  Phi  '50,  the  oldest  living  Zete,  was  in  attendance 
constantly  throughout  the  session,  as  the  only  living  member  who 
had  for  the  space  of  half  a  century  worn  the  badge  of  Zeta  Psi,  and  as 
the  friend  and  associate  of  the  founders,  he  brought  home  to  the  brothers 
present  a  realization  of  the  venerable  age,  the  dignity  and  the  worth  of 
the  Fraternity.  Bro.  Geo.  S.  Woodhull,  Phi  '48,  the  first  member  of 
Zeta  Psi  to  be  graduated  from  college ;  Bro.  Geo.  S.  Mott,  Phi  '50,  Bro. 
Judson  H.  Hopkins,  Delta  '50,  Bro.  John  Hess,  Delta  '50,  Bro.  Ezra  J. 
Peck,  Zeta  '51,  and  many  other  elders  of  the  pioneer  days  were  present  to 
see  the  fruits  of  their  labors  of  fifty  years  ago,  and  to  realize  that  they 
had  builded  better  than  they  knew. 

An  informal  complimentary  dinner  was  given  at  the  Hotel  St.  Denis, 
on  the  evening  of  the  23d,  at  which  Bro.  Francis  Lawton,  Epsilon 
'69,  presided.  Nearly  three  hundred  were  present  and  participated 
in  one  of  the  most  enjoyable  gatherings  ever  given  by  our  honored 
Fraternity.  The  banquet  was  held  at  Delmoiiico's  the  following 
evening,  with  Bro.  F.  LeRoy  Satterlee,  Phi  '66,  Phi  Alpha  of  the 
Fraternity,  as  the  presiding  officer,  and  Bro.  Wm.  H.  McElroy,  Theta 
'60,  as  toastmaster.  Again  nearly  three  hundred  men  testified  by 
their  presence  to  the  loyalty  which  animates  brothers  in  Tau  Kappa 
Phi.  Bro.  Nelson  Dingley,  Jr.,  Chi  '55,  the  illustrious  statesman 
whose  loss  we  have  since  been  called  upon  to  mourn,  sat  at  the  right  of 
the  president,  and  delivered  one  of  the  chief  addresses  of  the  evening. 
Bro.  Charles  H.  Eaton,  Kappa  '74,  one  of  New  York's  most  gifted  and 
eloquent  divines,  delivered  the  oration  and  well  sustained  his  reputation 
as  a  brilliant  orator,  while  Bro.  Wm.  H.  McElroy,  Theta  '60,  author 
and  journalist,  was  the  poet  of  the  occasion  and  read  a  masterly  pro- 
duction entitled  "When  this  Old  Pin  was  New,"  which  was  considered 
by  those  present  to  be  the  best  occasional  poem  the}'  had  ever  heard. 
Bros.  Carter,  Phi  '50,  Walker,  Rho  '55,  J.  W.  Bennett,  Phi  '53,  and 
other  prominent  elders  also  responded  to  toasts,  and  Bro.  M.  S.  Brown, 


ZETA  PSI  FRATERNITY  31 

Epsilon  '92,  read  an  historical  sketch  of  the  founding  of  the  Fraternity. 
The  unqualified  success  of  the  Convention  was  but  a  reflection  of  the 
remarkable  and,  up  to  that  time,  unequaled  prosperity  of  the  Fraternity, 
and  was  also  a  convincing  proof  of  Zeta  Psi's  position  as  one  of  the  lead- 
ers in  the  American  fraternity  world. 

Twice  only  in  the  half  century  of  its  history  has  the  Grand  Chapter 
failed  to  meet  in  a  general  convention.  The  failure  of  the  responsible 
officers  to  send  out  the  proper  notices  for  the  Convention  summoned  to 
meet  at  Philadelphia,  July  22,  1857,  resulted  in  the  failure  of  a  sufficient 
number  of  delegates  to  attend  in  order  to  constitute  a  quorum,  and  a 
special  session  of  Grand  Officers  was  held  in  New  York  City,  a  month 
later,  to  transact  the  necessary  business.  The  second  failure  was  due 
to  the  Civil  War.  The  Grand  Chapter  was  to  have  convened  in  the  sum- 
mer of  1861,  for  the  first  time  south  of  the  Mason  and  Dixon  line,  with 
the  Upsilon  Chapter  at  the  University  of  North  Carolina,  Chapel  Hill, 
North  Carolina.  The  war  so  absorbed  the  attention  and  energies  of  all 
that  no  attempt  was  made  to  find  another  host  for  the  Convention. 

New  York  has  the  distinction  of  having  entertained  the  Grand  Chap- 
ter at  twelve  regular  sessions,  besides  more  than  that  number  of  special 
sessions  of  the  Convention  or  of  its  Grand  Chapter  Officers.  The  Uni- 
versity of  Pennsylvania  has  been  the  host  of  the  Fraternity  six  times, 
and  Boston  has  been  the  place  of  meeting  four  times.  Providence,  New 
Brunswick  and  Easton  have  each  had  the  honor  three  times,  and  Ithaca, 
Toronto  and  Montreal  twice.  Regular  conventions  have  been  held  once 
in  each  of  the  following  cities :  Williamstown,  Newburgh,  Poughkeep- 
sie,  Brooklyn,  Springfield,  Hartford,  Waterville,  Hanover,  Schenectady, 
Cleveland,  Troy  and  Syracuse. 

The  Grand  Chapter  of  the  Fraternity  has,  since  1859,  regularly 
published  the  Minutes  of  each  Annual  Convention.  The  copies  of  un- 
printed  minutes  of  the  earlier  conventions  have  fortunately  been  pre- 
served, with  the  exception  of  those  of  1851,  but  their  substance  has  been 
gathered  from  correspondence  of  the  time,  so  that  the  Fraternity  has  in 
its  archives,  thanks  to  the  unremitting  labors  of  the  Delta  Alpha,  a 
practically  complete  official  record  of  its  history.  The  publications  of 
the  Fraternity,  in  addition  to  its  minutes,  have  been  bulletins,  song- 
books,  a  Zeta  Psi  Monthly,  a  Zeta  Psi  Quarterly,  directories  and  cata- 
logues. 

The  value  of  a  Zeta  Psi  songbook  was  early  recognized  and  many 
efforts  were  made  to  collect  and  preserve  the  Fraternity  songs.  As  early 
as  1855,  the  Grand  Chapter  appointed  a  committee  for  this  purpose. 
Similar  committees  were  appointed  from  time  to  time  but  failed  to  do  more 
than  make  partial  collections  of  Zeta  Psi  songs  until,  in  1869,  a  com- 
mittee from  the  Psi  Chapter  at  Cornell  was  given  power  to  publish  a 
songbook  for  the  Fraternity.  In  1871,  this  committee,  of  which  Bro.  J.  M. 
Dodge,  '71,  was  chairman,  printed  and  published  the  first  book  of  Zeta 
Psi  songs  without  music.  The  '71  book,  notwithstanding  repeated 
attempts  to  publish  a  new  collection,  remained  the  only  one  until  Bro. 
Bolles,  Kappa  '88,  chairman  of  a  songbook  committee  appointed  by  the 
Grand  Chapter  in  1889,  succeeded  in  publishing,  in  1891,  the  second  Zeta 
Psi  songbook,  words  and  music.  One  of  the  features  of  the  semicenten- 
nial year  was  the  publication  by  a  committee,  consisting  of  Bro.  Israel 
C.  Pierson,  Phi  '65,  and  Bro.  Thomas  I.  Chatfield,  Eta  '93,  of  a  Zeta  Psi 
songbook  with  words  and  music,  the  former  exclusively  of  Zeta  Psi 
authorship.  This  book  was  in  every  way  worthy  of  the  Fraternity  whose 
badge  ornaments  the  cover,  the  beautiful  design  for  which  and  the  first 
page  was  drawn  by  Bro.  F.  T.  Clayton,  Phi  '96. 

The  Grand  Chapter  at  the  Syracuse  Convention,  1882,  voted  to  pub- 
lish a  monthly  journal  devoted  to  the  interests  of  Zeta  Psi.  The  Zeta 
Psi  Monthly  was  first  issued  in  November,  1882,  at  Toronto,  Canada, 
under  the  editorship  of  Bro.  Henry  Brock,  Theta  Xi  '81,  who  as- 
sumed not  only  the  editorial  but  also  the  financial  responsibility  of  the 


32  ZETA  PSI  FRATERNITY 

enterprise.  Three  numbers  were  published  by  Bro.  Brock,  who  then 
became  convinced  that  Toronto  was  too  far  from  the  centre  of  Zeta  Psi  in- 
terests and  activities  and  so  resigned  the  editorship  in  favor  of  Bro.  J.  Bruen 
Miller,  Delta  '79,  who  accepted  the  office  and  the  responsibility  of  pub- 
lication. Bro.  Miller  continued  as  editor  of  the  monthly  and  of  its  suc- 
cessor, the  Zeta  Psi  Quarterly,  until  March,  1885.  Bro.  Walter  G.  Eliot, 
Alpha  '78,  followed  him  as  ad  interim  editor,  and  Bro.  Ruford  Franklin, 
Alpha  '86,  was  chosen  as  his  successor  and  served  as  editor  until  the 
discontinuance  of  the  publication  in  1886.  The  monthly  was  a  private 
enterprise,  although  recognized  as  the  official  organ  of  the  Fraternity. 
The  quarterly  was  published  by  the  Zeta  Psi  Publishing-  Co.,  a  stock 
company  whose  shares  were  subscribed  for  by  members  of  the  Fraternity. 
Bro.  J.  Bruen  Miller  and  his  associates  conferred  a  great  benefit  upon 
the  Fraternity  by  their  arduous  and  unremunerative  labors  in  their  suc- 
cessful endeavors  to  give  Zeta  Psi  a  journal  worthy  of  its  position  in  the 
college  fraternity  world. 

The  Fraternity  has  from  time  to  time  published  catalogues  and  direc- 
tories of  its  members.  The  first  attempt  to  publish  a  catalogue  was 
made  in  1853,  the  Convention  of  that  year  voting  to  publish  a  catalogue 
within  a  year.  Two  years  passed  and  no  catalogue  appeared.  A  com- 
mittee was  appointed  in  the  Convention  of  1855  to  inquire  into  the  delay 
in  the  publication  of  the  catalogue.  In  1857  all  former  catalogue  com- 
mittees were  discharged  and  a  new  one  was  chosen,  with  full  power  to 
publish  a  catalogue  as  soon  as  possible,  and  the  efficient  chairman  of 
the  committee,  Bro.  G.  L.  Bennett,  Rho  '54,  having  been  ably  assisted 
by  Judson  H.  Hopkins,  Delta  '50,  as  mentioned  before,  had  the  honor  of 
reporting  to  the  Grand  Chapter  in  1859  that  the  first  Zeta  Psi  Catalogue 
had  been  published. 

The  movement  for  a  second  catalogue  began  in  1864,  with  a  motion 
that  a  new  catalogue  be  published  by  the  Grand  Chapter,  a  motion  made 
by  Bro.  Israel  C.  Pierson,  Phi  '65,  who  thus  thirty-five  years  ago  was 
actively  interested  in  the  affairs  of  the  Fraternity.  Bros.  Charles  H. 
Tillinghaste,  Theta  '64,  Albert  H.  Gallatin,  Phi  '59,  Henry  T.  Thomas, 
Omega  '64,  Lewis  S.  Pilcher,Xi  '62,  A.  W.  Bailey,  Phi  '65,  and  Satterlee 
Arnold,  Pi  '66,  were  appointed  a  committee  for  the  purpose,  and  after 
three  years'  labor,  published  in  1867,  the  second  catalogue  of  the  Zeta 
Psi  Fraternity,  which  contained  1,314  names.  Bro.  Samuel  Marsh,  Phi 
'67,  advanced  for  its  publication  a  large  sum  of  money.  He  subsequently 
generously  canceled  a  very  considerable  portion  of  the  debt  to  himself 
which  the  Fraternity  had  thus  incurred.  In  1874  the  Grand  Chapter 
published  an  "addenda"  to  the  catalogue  of  1867  with  575  names,  by  a 
committee  consisting  of  W.  L.  Otis,  Pi  '74,  C.  M.  Knight,  Kappa  '73,  J. 
E.  Ensign,  Xi  '74,  and  H.  C.  Drake,  Psi  '72.  The  fourth  catalogue  of 
the  Fraternity  was  published  in  1884,  after  three  years  of  labor,  by  a 
committee  consisting  of  Bros.  Charles  B.  Everson,  Psi  '78  (chairman),  D. 
Cady  Gere,  Gamma  '79,  and  Charles  G.  Belden,  Gamma  '79.  The  publi- 
cation of  this  volume  was  so  wisely  managed  that  Bro.  Everson  was  able 
to  report  to  the  convention  that,  although  the  cost  of  publication  exceeded 
two  thousand  dollars,  the  entire  expense  had  been  met  and  no  debt  re- 
mained for  the  Grand  Chapter  to  assume.  There  were  2,724  names. 

Bro.  Wyatt  G.  Johnston,  Alpha  Psi  '84,  issued,  in  1888,  a  directory 
of  members  of  the  Fraternity,  with  addresses  as  then  known.  Bro.  Samuel 
B.  Sumner,  Zeta  '49,  published  a  partial  list  of  new  members  in  1889, 
and  in  1892,  Bros.  J.Howard  Ford,  Psi  '77  (chairman),  William  A.  Hoe, 
Jr.,  Phi  '88,  and  Israel  C.  Pierson,  Phi  '65,  were  appointed  a  committee 
to  publish  a  complete  directory  of  the  Fraternity.  Within  one  year  the 
Zeta  Psi  Directory  was  issued,  containing  a  remarkablj7  complete  and 
accurate  list  of  4,005  members,  with  addresses  and  alphabetical  and 
geographical  indexes.  This  directory,  however,  was  meant  to  be  simply 
the  initial  step  in  the  publication  of  a  great  biographical  catalogue. 
The  same  committee  was  continued  in  power,  and  has  for  over  five  years 


ZETA  PSI  FRATERNITY  33 

labored  on  this  undertaking.  The  lamented  death  of  Bro.  Hoe  deprived 
the  committee  of  a  valuable  worker,  and  Bro.  Pomeroy  Ladue,  Xi  '90, 
was  appointed  in  his  place.  Bro.  Pierson,  as  secretary  of  the  committee, 
has  devoted  himself  to  the  task  of  editing-  and  publishing  this  catalogue 
with  a  singleness  of  purpose  and  an  unselfish  devotion  of  time  and  energy 
which  places  the  whole  Fraternity  under  a  deep  debt  of  gratitude  to  him. 
This  monumental  work,  the  Zeta  Psi  Biographical  Catalogue  of  1899, 
crowns  the  list  of  the  Fraternity's  publications. 

The  remarkable  improvement  in  internal  organization  which  has  char- 
acterized the  last  two  decades  has  been  manifested  in  one  very  important 
phase  in  the  care  that  has  been  given  to  the  collection  and  to  the  preserva- 
tion of  the  archives  of  the  Fraternity.  In  1884  an  archivist  was  appointed, 
and  historical  matter,  long  scattered,  was  collected.  Bro.  Pierson,  Phi 
'65,  has  been  archivist  since  1895,  and  has  gathered  and  preserved  in- 
valuable muniments  of  our  early  history.  A  systematic  effort  has  been 
made  to  secure  material  illustrating  the  origin  and  growth  of  the  Frater- 
nity. Many  members  have  turned  over  to  the  Delta  Alpha  papers  of 
great  value  which  in  private  hands  would  inevitably  have  been  lost  in  the 
course  of  time.  These  sources  for  the  history  of  Zeta  Psi  are  securely 
kept  in  a  room  devoted  to  that  purpose  in  a  fireproof  building  in  New 
York  City.  The  preservation  of  the  more  valuable  records  and  papers  is 
doubly  secured  by  means  of  a  fireproof  safe. 

One  of  the  great  difficulties  with  which  all  fraternities  have  to  con- 
tend is  the  tendency  of  graduate  members  to  become  absorbed  in  busi- 
ness, professional  or  family  cares,  and,  to  a  degree,  forget  the  asso- 
ciations of  college  days  to  which  they  owe  so  much  of  pleasure  and  of 
profit.  Zeta  Psi  has  endeavored  to  counteract  this  tendency  by  the  for- 
mation of  associations  of  Elders  at  different  centres.  Such  associations 
have  been  or  now  are,  with  great  benefit  to  the  Fraternity,  existent  at 
Boston,  New  York,  Philadelphia,  Washington,  Cleveland,  Detroit, 
Chicago  and  San  Francisco. 

A  fraternity  is  known  by  its  sons.  Judged  by  that  test  Zeta  Psi 
holds  a  proud  rank  in  the  list  of  American  fraternities.  Its  Elders 
have  won  distinction  in  every  honorable  branch  of  public  and  private 
activity.  United  States  Senators  and  Representatives,  State  Governors 
and  legislators,  diplomats,  army  and  navy  officers,  college  presidents 
and  professors,  eminent  jurists  on  the  national  and  State  benches,  promi- 
nent lawyers,  clergymen,  physicians,  journalists  and  authors,  success- 
ful financiers  and  business  men  attest  the  intellectual  and  moral  worth 
of  the  men  whom  Zeta  Psi  has  honored  with  membership  in  her  mystic 
circle.  To  a  remarkable  degree  have  the  Alumni  of  Zeta  Psi  been  suc- 
cessful men.  The  Fraternity  justly  prides  itself  upon  the  attainments 
and  social  standing  of  the  average  member,  whose  success  is,  after  all, 
a  better  criterion  of  the  real  worth  of  the  Fraternity  than  the  achieve- 
ments of  those  who  have  won  national  reputations. 

Zeta  Psi,  with  a  muster  roll  of  about  five  thousand  and  fifty 
members,  of  whom  nearly  four  thousand  two  hundred  are  living, 
enters  upon  its  second  half-century  of  existence  with  ample  justi- 
fication for  the  belief  that  the  future  has  abounding  prosperity  in  store 
for  the  Fraternity  which  so  proudly  bears  its  name.  Never  during  its  half- 
century  of  history  has  Zeta  Psi  been  so  strong,  and  never  have  the  indi- 
vidual chapters  and  the  Grand  Chapter  been  so  effectively  organized  for  a 
successful  prosecution  of  the  work  for  which  they  were  constituted.  Zeta 
Psi  has  nobly  carried  out  the  plans  and  fulfilled  the  ideals  of  the  honored 
founders  of  the  Fraternity.  The  work  which  they  instituted  has  grown 
to  proportions  far  surpassing  their  most  sanguine  expectations.  For 
over  half  a  century  has  Zeta  Psi  vitally  influenced  for  good  the  lives  of 
successive  generations  of  college  men,  who  have  taken  upon  themselves 
the  obligations  and  vows  of  the  initiate.  Character  has  been  builded  and 
manhood  developed.  Loyalty,  truth,  honor  and  love  have  been  taught  as 
essential  elements  in  the  character  of  every  true  son  of  Zeta  Psi.  Formed 


34  ZETA  PSI  FRATERNITY 

upon  such  principles,  inspired  by  the  examples  of  self-sacrifice  and 
noble  endeavor  with  which  its  history  is  replete  and  supported  by  the  loyal 
devotion  of  enthusiastic  sons,  the  weal  of  Zeta  Psi  is  assured.  So  long  as 
Tau  Kappa  Phi  shall  actuate  the  lives  and  motives  of  its  members,  prog- 
ress and  prosperity  will  be  chronicled  by  its  historians  and  the  Zeta 
Psi  Fraternity  of  North  America  will  maintain  its  present  honored  posi- 
tion in  the  American  fraternity  world.

HISTORY  OF  THE  PHI  CHAPTER 

The  early  history  of  the  Phi  Chapter  of  Zeta  Psi  is  the  story  of  the 
birth  and  primitive  days  of  the  Fraternity.  Its  founder  was  John  Bradt 
Yates  Sommers,  its  birthplace  was  New  York  University,  in  the  build- 
ing which  stood  on  Washington  Square,  New  York,  from  1835  until  1894. 

A  few  prominent  citizens  of  New  York  met  on  December  16,  1829, 
to  consider  "the  establishment  of  a  University  on  a  liberal  and  exten- 
sive foundation."  A  standing  committee,  appointed  at  a  second  confer- 
ence which  was  held  on  January  6,  1830,  secured,  for  the  new  enterprise, 
a  large  number  of  subscribers  who,  on  October  16,  1830,  organized  and 
elected  the  first  Council  of  the  University  of  the  City  of  New  YorkJ,  which 
was  chartered  as  the  corporation  or  governing  body  on  April  16,  1831. 

The  first  president  of  the  Council  of  New  York  University  was  Albert 
Gallatin,  who  had  been  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  under  Jefferson  and 
Madison  for  twelve  years,  Minister  to  France  eight  years  from  1815,  and 
Ambassador  Extraordinary  to  London  in  1826.  He  was  the  grandfather 
of  Bros.  Albert  H.  Gallatin,  '59,  and  Frederick  Gallatin,  '61.  The  first 
Chancellor  was  Rev.  James  M.  Matthews,  D.D.,  from  1831  to  1839,  when 
he  was  succeeded  by  an  uncle  of  Bro.  Frederick  Frelinghuysen,  Delta 
'68,  Theodore  Frelinghuysen,  LL.  D.,  who  had  been  Attorney-General  of 
New  Jersey  and  U.  S.  Senator.  During  his  chancellorship,  1839  to 
1850,  Zeta  Psi  came  to  light.  Myndert  Van  Schaick,  the  grandfather  of 
Eugene  Van  Schaick  of  the  Alpha  and  Phi  Chapters,  was  one  of  the 
original  promoters  of  the  University  and  the  first  treasurer  of  the  Council. 

College  work  was  begun  in  October,  1832,  in  Clinton  Hall,  Bleecker 
Street,  near  Broadway.  In  1833  was  graduated  the  first  class  which 
consisted  of  three  men,  one  of  whom  was  a  brother  of  John  C.  Acheson, 
M.  D. ,  a  Zeta  Psi  of  the  class  of  1853. 

The  building  on  Washington  Square  was  finished  and  occupied 
in  1835,  in  which  year  the  law  school  was  started  by  Hon.  B.  F. 
Butler  of  New  York.  In  the  same  year  Prof.  S.  F.  B.  Morse,  of  the 
Faculty  of  Arts  and  Science,  uncle  of  W.  H.  Morse,  $  '72,  applied 
the  use  of  electricity  to  the  recording  telegraph  and  sent  the  first  tele- 
gram from  the  room  which  he  occupied  in  the  University  Building. 
Among  the  other  things  which  N.  Y.  U.  has  given  to  the  world,  this 
and  another  rank  with  the  most  useful  inventions  of  the  wonderful  century 
now  closing;  the  other  dates  from  1839,  when  Prof.  John  W.  Draper  pro- 
duced in  the  University  Buildingthe  first  sun  picture  of  the  human  face. 
The  opening  of  the  School  of  Medicine  under  Dr.  Valentine  Mott,  in 
1841,  completed  the  University  establishment  as  proposed  by  himself  and 
the  other  founders. 

New  York  University  was  just  entering  upon  the  fourteenth  year  of 
college  work  when,  in  1845,  the  founder  of  Zeta  Psi,  John  B.  Yates  Som- 
mers, was  admitted  as  a  Freshman  in  the  class  of  '49,  having  just 
completed  his  sixteenth  year.  Although  there  were  already  chapters  of 
three  strong  fraternities  in  N.  Y.  U. ,  Bro.  Sommers  early  in  his  college 
course  decided  to  organize  a  new  fraternity  according  to  his  own  ideals 
and  for  this  purpose  associated  with  himself  Bros.  W.  H.  Dayton*  and 
J.  M.  Skillman  '49,  and  founded  Zeta  Psi  on  June  1,  1847f.  Sketches^ 
of  these  three  founders  are  given  elsewhere.  They  prepared  the  consti- 
tution, by-laws,  initiation  service,  pledge  and  other  details  of  the  scheme 
of  the  Fraternity.  The  earliest  recorded  minutes  extant  are  those  of  a 
meeting  of  the  Phi  §  Chapter,  held  at  the  home  of  Bro.  Sommers,  82 

II  The  name  was  changed  to  New  York  University  on  March  19, 1896.

38  PHI  CHAPTER 

Madison  Street,  New  York,  on  September  15, 1847,  when  he,  as  secretary, 
and  Bro.  Skillman,  as  president,  were  the  only  ones  present — the  only 
members  of  the  Fraternity.  The  first  initiation  occurred  on  September  27, 

1847,  the  second  on  October  13,  1847.     The  two  men  then  initiated  were  ac- 
tually engaged  in  promoting  the  new  enterprise  for  awhile  but   subse- 
quently became  discouraged.     Their  names  were  dropped  from  the  roll 
by  appropriate  action,  however  several  cousins  of  the  first  and  two  sons 
of  the  second  are  now  in  the  Zeta  Psi  fold.     The  third  addition  to  the 
fraternity  was  Rev.  William  Henry  Carter,  D.  D.,  LL.  D.,  '50,  now  of 
Tallahassee,  Fla.,  who  was  admitted  on  November  6,  1847.     All  delight 
to  honor  him  as  the  oldest  living  initiate.     Bro.  Skillman,  in  his  address 
on  December  18,  1847,  at  the  close  of  his  term  of  office,  said:  "I  know  of 
nothing    more  encouraging  than  the  present  flourishing  state  of  our 
Fraternity.     To  be  sure  we  do  not  number  as  many  as  the   majority  of 
the   societies  in  the  University  but  I  am  equally  certain  there  is  none 
where  greater  unanimity  and  brotherly  love  exist  among  the  members 
and  I  think  I  may  say  with  propriety  and  truth,  'We  were  weak  but 
are  strong. ' ' '    Then  there  was  one  chapter  with  five  members. 

The  year  1848  saw  fourteen  accessions  to  Zeta  Psi  (two  of  whom 
later  deserted  the  little  band)  and  the  founding  of  the  first  two  new 
chapters.  Rev.  George  S.  Woodhull,  D.  D.,  '48,  now  of  East  Saginaw, 
Mich.,  the  fourth  acquisition,  initiated  on  March  25,  1848,  was  the  first 
Zete  to  be  graduated.  Rev.  George  S.  Mott,  D.  D.,  '50,  of  Newark,  N.  J., 
was  the  fifth  to  join  the  new  enterprise.  The  sixth  and  seventh  additions 
were  Rufus  Button,  '49,  and  Henry  S.  Hodges,  Williams,  '49,  on  May  11, 

1848.  The  first  step  toward  extending  the  fraternity  was  taken  on  May 
23,  1848,  when  the  Zeta  Chapter  was  founded ;  the  second  step  on  November 
24, 1848,  when  the  foundation  of  the  Delta  Chapter  at  Rutgers  College  was 
laid  by  the  initiation  of  JudsonH.  Hopkins  and  John  Hess,  both  of  the  class 
of  '50,  of  that  college,  the  thirteenth  and  fourteenth  additions  respectively. 

Those  pioneers  of  Zeta  Psi  were  men  of  strong  faith,  indomitable 
courage,  unflinching  zeal  and  boundless  enthusiasm.  The  only  survivors  of 
the  first  year  of  Zeta  Psi,  June  1,  1847,  to  June  1,  1848,  are  the  trio,  Bros. 
Carter,  Woodhull  and  Mott.  In  addition  to  winning  college  mates,  Carter 
devised  the  motto,  T  K  $,  and  Mott  invented  the  pass- word  while  Wood- 
hull  was  the  most  successful  promoter  both  in  college  and  after  grad- 
uation. He  was  a  hustler  for  Zeta  Psi  and  could  give  some  points  to  the 
modern  rusher.  His  influence  brought  Hodges  from  Williamstown  and 
Hopkins  and  Hess  from  New  Brunswick,  to  New  York  to  be  initiated 
into  the  mysteries  of  Zeta  Psi  so  as  to  introduce  the  new  Fraternity 
into  their  respective  colleges.  In  his  address  at  the  Anniversary  Cele- 
bration, June  4,  1849,  he  said:  "  May  we  long  be  spared  and,  when  old 
age  hath  overtaken  us  and  our  sons  shall  occupy  our  places,  may  we  meet 
and  with  hearts  as  young  as  now  rejoice  together  in  the  meridian  glory  of 
Zeta  Psi. "  At  that  time  there  were  three  chapters  and  thirty  members. 

During  the  early  years  the  abiding  place  of  the  chapter  was  some- 
what nomadic,  meetings  having  been  held  at  the  homes  of  Bro.  Sommers 
and  other  members  or  in  rooms  rented  in  different  places  to  suit  the 
convenience  and  circumstances  of  the  Brothers  for,  being  only  a  few  in 
number  and  having  an  initiation  fee  of  but  $1.00  at  first  and  then  $2.00 
and  dues  of  12^  c.  per  month,  the  infant  chapter  had  a  limited  income 
with  which  it  was  necessary  to  make  the  expenses  of  meetings  and  of 
administration  commensurate.  As  the  income  increased,  by  acquisition 
of  men  and  the  advance  of  fee  and  dues,  the  chapter  secured  more  per- 
manent quarters,  the  latest  downtown  being  at  21  University  Place  until 
June,  1894.  During  nearly  all  of  the  period  at  Washington  Square, 
1847-94,  the  association  in  college  work  was  included  within  a  few  hours — • 
chapel,  9.30  A.  M.  and  recitations,  10  A.  M.  to  1  or  2  p.  M.  Chapter  meet- 
ings were  held  weekly,  much  of  the  time  alternately  afternoon  and 
evening.  Although  the  members  were  widely  scattered  as  to  residence 
and  chapter  life  had  its  limitations  the  brothers  were  bound  closely 


PHI  CHAPTER  39 

together  and  derived  great  pleasure  and  profit  from  their  fraternity 
experiences. 

The  encroachment  of  business  enterprises,  immediately  after  the  Civil 
War,  on  the  hitherto  residence  neighborhood  of  Washington  Square,  the 
want  of  dormitory  life  and  influences  which  it  is  not  necessary  to  men- 
tion here,  impeded  development,  but  the  spirit  of  the  founders  remained. 
The  Phi  Chapter,  with  all  those  interested  in  New  York  University, 
had  firm  faith  that  sooner  or  later  there  would  be  a  change  which  came 
in  1881  when  Rev.  John  Hall,  D.  D.,  was  elected  the  fifth  Chancellor, 
and  the  tide  turned.  Commodore  David  Banks,  of  the  Phi  Chapter, 
always  active  and  enthusiastic  in  allN.Y.  U.  affairs,  whether  financial, 
educational  or  athletic,  when  in  1890,  the  Council  voted  to  move  the  college 
work  uptown  and  appointed  a  committee,  with  himself  as  chairman,  to 
secure  grounds,  immediately  made  thorough  investigation  and  selected 
an  estate  of  forty  acres  beyond  the  Harlem  River,  between  Morris 
Heights  and  Fordham  Heights.  The  committee  unanimously  approved 
his  choice  and  recommended  the  purchase  of  the  available  part  of  it. 
Subsequently  the  Council  adopted  the  report  of  the  committee  and  in  1892 
acquired  the  site  for  the  University  College.  Meanwhile,  in  1891,  Dr. 
Hall  resigned  and  was  succeeded  by  Rev.  Henry  M.  MacCracken,  D.  D., 
LL.  D.,  the  sixth  Chancellor  of  N.  Y.  U.,  he  having  occupied  the  Chair  of 
Philosophy  since  1884  and  held  the  office  of  Vice-Chancellor  since  1885. 

After  the  usual  exercises  in  celebration  of  Founders'  Day,  on  April 
18,  1894,  stones  were  removed  from  the  old  Washington  Square  building 
and  transported  under  escort  to  University  Heights,  which  the  site  was 
named.  The  Phi  Chapter  boys  went  in  a  tally-ho  and  joined  in  the  cere- 
mony of  laying  the  corner  stone  of  the  first  building.  Bro.  Harry  H.  Wat- 
son, 1900,  took  the  photographs  of  the  group  of  N.  Y.  U.  college  buildings 
(in  this  book),  the  construction  of  which  is  a  part  of  what  has  been  accom- 
plished under  Chancellor  MacCracken's  administration. 

The  hopes  and  expectations  cherished  for  many  years  by  the  Phi 
Chapter,  as  well  as  by  the  University  Council,  Alumni  and  students, 
were  realized  when  the  college  work  was  moved  in  October  1894  to  the 
new  site.  Some  of  the  professional  schools  are  necessarily  separated  as 
to  location  from  the  college,  those  of  Law,  Pedagogy  and  Post  Graduate 
work  (in  part)  being  conducted  in  the  new  ten-story  building  at  Wash- 
ington Square;  that  of  Medicine  at  East  26th  Street,  near  2d  Avenue,  in 
close  proximity  toBellevue  Hospital.  But  the  strength  of  the  chapter  lies 
in  the  departments  at  University  Heights,  from  which  nearly  all  of  the 
candidates  for  membership  are  chosen.  Here  on  the  plateau  at  an  eleva- 
tion of  nearly  200  feet  above  the  Harlem  River,  looking  out  upon  the 
Hudson  River  bounded  by  the  Palisades,  and  commanding  a  view  of  the 
upper  part  of  Manhattan  Island  as  well  as  the  country  east  and  north, 
is  the  college  quadrangle.  On  the  west  side  of  it  stands  the  Library, 
having  cost  nearly  $1,000,000,  and  Language  Hall,  while  near  by  are 
located  Havemeyer  Chemical  Laboratory  and  other  buildings  on  the 
south  side.  On  the  east  side  is  Ohio  Field,  with  its  quarter-mile  track, 
the  gridiron  and  diamond,  on  the  south  of  which  stands  the  gymnasium. 
Beyond  is  Gould  Hall,  one  of  the  best  built  and  equipped  dormitories. 

Such  were  the  auspicious  conditions  and  prospects  under  which 
began  the  new  era  for  the  Phi  Chapter,  the  closing  years  of  the  first  and 
the  early  years  of  the  second  semicentennium.  For  the  first  year,  1894-5, 
the  chapter  occupied  a  house  on  Hampden  Street  and  had  the  first  expe- 
rience in  chapter  house  life  but  in  1895  they  leased  a  house  which  is 
almost  as  well  adapted  for  chapter  use  as  if  it  had  been  built  for  the 
purpose.  The  brothers  are  now  enjoying  their  fifth  year  in  this  home 
to  which  they  have  become  attached  by  many  hours  and  days  of  frater- 
nal association.  It  is  plainly  yet  comfortably  furnished  but  there  is 
always  a  hearty  welcome  to  elders  or  brothers  of  the  Phi  or  other  chap- 
ters. In  the  music  room  is  the  piano  which,  by  the  purchase  of  the 
brothers  of  about  1888,  adorned  the  old  room  at  21  University  Place. 


40  PHI  CHAPTER 

Thanks  to  the  care  taken  of  it  by  Bro.  Samuel  F.  Lindeman,  '88,  it  is 
in  good  condition,  and  adds  much  to  the  pleasure  of  the  present  members. 
This  house  and  the  lot  for  the  permanent  chapter  house  are  located  on 
Andrews  Avenue,  astreet  named  afterthe  father  of  Bro.  Clarence  Andrews, 
'73,  Mr.  Loring  Andrews,  who  gave  $100,000  to  the  general  endowment 
of  New  York  University  in  1864,  his  home  then  being  the  present  resi- 
dence of  Chancellor  MacCracken.  The  elders  have  incorporated  the  "Phi 
Chapter  Association"  for  the  purpose  of  holding  property  and  erecting 
a  chapter  house,  for  which  a  lot  100x100  has  been  secured  on  the  corner 
of  Andrews  and  University  Avenues,  immediately  opposite  Ohio  Field. 
There  is  good  prospect  that  soon  the  Phi  Chapter  House  will  be  a  reality 
as  well  as  an  adornment  to  the  college  community.  In  this  move  there 
is  much  active  interest  on  the  part  of  the  elders  as  well  as  undergraduates. 
The  officers  of  the  association,  P.  L.  Schenck,  M.  D.,  '62,  president;  J. 
V.  S.  Woolley,  M.  D.,  '67,  vice-president;  Walter  J.  Greacen,  '96,  secre- 
tary; James  Boyd,  '82,  treasurer,  and  the  executive  committee,  as  well 
as  members,  are  working  for  this  consummation. 

It  is  difficult  to  select  out  of  the  347  members  of  the  chapter  a  few 
only  of  those  who  have  honored  themselves  as  well  as  Zeta  Psi  in 
the  faithful  performance  of  duty  in  the  several  stations  and  circles  of 
their  service  and  influence,  whether  one  has  been  college  president, 
bishop,  pastor,  judge,  lawyer,  writer  of  standard  works,  banker, 
business  man,  etc.,  in  public  or  in  private  life,  in  peace  or  in  war. 
The  biographies  contain  the  names  of  many  brothers  who  are  on  the 
Phi  Beta  Kappa  roll  and  in  the  list  of  valedictorians  and  high  honor 
and  prize  men.  They  occupy  prominent  places  in  class  and  college 
organizations,  and  have  been  active  in  the  Alumni  Association,  as  officers 
and  members  of  committees,  one  as  Chairman  of  the  Committee  on  the 
first  N.  Y.  U.  Alumni  Biographical  Catalogue  of  1894,  while  four  are  on 
the  University  Council. 

The  chapter  had  many  representatives  in  the  Civil  War.  One  of  the 
founders  of  Zeta  Psi,  Bro.  John  M.  Skillman,  was  in  the  U.  S.  Navy. 
In  the  army  were  Bros.  W.  H.  Carter  and  G.  S.  Woodhull,  as  chaplains, 
and  Bros.  G.  M.  Van  Hoesen,  with  the  rank  of  major,  E.  M.  Felt,  W. 
G.  Wheelwright,  J.  J.  Gilette  (a  prisoner  five  months  in  Libby  prison), 
J.  N.  Lewis,  J.  C.  Carter  and  A.  H.  Gallatin  (surgeons),  A.  C.  Bishop 
(hospital  service),  W.  De  F.  Prentiss,  J.  G.  Derrickson  (a  prisoner  ten 
months),  F.  Gallatin,  G.  N.  Gardiner,  P.  D.  Schenck  (surgeon),  W.  R. 
Syme,  J.  C.  Chalmers,  C.  C.  Van  Inwegen  and  C.  S.  Halstead.  In  the  navy 
were  Bros.  J.  A.  Walker  and  H.  C.  Van  Gieson  (surgeons)  and  Isaac  New- 
ton as  assistant  to  Capt.  John  Ericsson  at  the  request  of  the  latter,  in 
construction  of  the  U.  S.  ram  "Monitor,"  of  which  he  was  chief  engineer 
of  a  volunteer  crew  in  the  battle  with  the  "Merrimac,"  1862.  Capt. 
Worden  complimented  him  for  "coolness,  skill  and  energy."  Afterwards 
he  superintended  the  construction  of  the  "Puritan"  and  "Dictator," 
and  remained  in  the  navy  until  1865.  In  the  Confederate  service  were 
brothers  who  manifested  the  same  spirit  of  bravery,  courage  and  devo- 
tion as  did  those  on  the  other  side,  Bros.  Salem  Dutcher  as  adjutant 
and  Howard  C.  Wright  as  captain.  The  latter  wrote  "Account  of  the 
Siege  of  Port  Hudson,"  which  was  published  in  Harper's  and  is  said 
to  be  one  of  the  best  articles  on  that  subject.  Some  of  those  engaged 
in  the  Spanish-American  War  were  Bros.  Augustus  Van  Gieson,  '72, 
C.  F.  Gardner,  '91,  R.  R.  Wedekind,  '91,  Geo.  Wedekind,  '92,  and  Paul 
Grout,  '94,  in  the  army,  and  T.  T.  T.  Craven,  1901,  in  the  navy.  The 
biographies  contain  the  details  of  rank  and  service  which  for  lack  of 
space  it  is  necessary  to  omit  here. 

Among  those  in  educational  circles  are  Bros.  J.  M.  Van  Vleck,  '50, 
as  Acting  President  of  Wesleyan  University,  and  Bro.  John  J.  Rice,  '64, 
as  Acting  President  of  Westminster  College,  and  four  of  the  nine  Zeta 
Psi  Professors  or  Instructors  in  the  Faculties  of  the  University.  On  the 
Faculties  in  the  past  were  Bros.  A.  H.  Gallatin,  '59,  and  H.  G.  Piffard,  '62. 


PHI  CHAPTER  41 

Bro.  George  M.  Van  Hoesen,  '52,  adorned  the  bench  for  fourteen  years. 
Bro.  Charles  DeW.  Bridgman,  '55,  was  held  in  high  esteem  and,  had  he 
lived,  would  probably  have  been  chosen  in  the  Episcopal  Church  to  the 
office  of  Bishop  which  Bro.  D.  A.  Goodsell,  '59,  holds  in  the  Methodist 
Church.  If  the  episcopate  were  for  Presbyterians,  Bro.  John  McVey, 
'60,  and  others  might  be  considered  available  candidates. 

Bro.  Joseph  Nimmo,  Jr. ,  '53,  has  written  many  books  and  articles  on 
commerce,  economics  and  industrial  statistics.  Bro.  A.  A.  Redfield,  '60, 
was  co-author  of  "Shearman  and  Redfield  on  Negligence. "  His  "Red- 
field's  Surrogate's  Practice,"  "Redfield's  Surrogate's  Reports,"  and 
other  works  are  the  standard  text  books  and  authorities  on  the  subject. 
Bro.  Salem  Dutcher,  '58,  is  the  author  of  "Minority  Representation," 
"Expressions  of  Law  and  Fact  construed  by  the  Courts  of  Georgia," 
and  other  works.  Among  the  many  other  authors  and  writers  of  the 
chapter  are  Bros.  C.  R.  Barnes,  '63,  and  F.  L.  R.  Satterlee,  '65. 

Mention  might  be  made  of  Bros.  F.  A.  Wilcox,  '60,  counsel  of  many 
railroad  and  steamship  companies;  David  Banks,  the  head  of  the  firm  of 
Banks  Bros.,  the  largest  and  oldest  law  publishing  house  in  this  country; 
H.  W.  Bragg,  '61,  of  Boston,  bar  examiner  and  justice;  L.  Skidmore,  '61, 
member  of  N.  Y.  U.  Council;  E.  H.  Litchfield,  '67,  Commissioner  N.  Y. 
State  Board  of  Charities  since  1893,  member  of  N.  Y.  U.  Council  several 
years;  A.  B.  Carlton,  '72,  Comptroller  of  Elizabeth,  N.  J.,  since  1883; 
Prince  Heromich  Shugeo,  '76,  of  Tokyo,  Japanese  Imperial  Commissioner 
to  the  Paris  Exposition  of  1900;  Alonzo  Blauvelt,  '73,  chief  of  the  Con- 
tagious Diseases  Department  of  the  N.  Y.  Board  of  Health;  M.  H.  Seligman, 
'75,  banker;  W.  F.  Whittemore,  '83,  consulting  engineer  for  water  and 
steamship  companies. 

The  Phi  Chapter,  in  addition  to  founding  the  Zeta  and  Delta  Chap- 
ters, has  taken  part  in  the  establishment  or  the  reestablishment  of  other 
chapters.  Bro.  Sommers  aided  to  establish  the  Sigma  Chapter.  Bro.  A. 
H.  Gallatin,  '59,  presided  at  the  reestablishment  of  the  Zeta  and  the 
founding  of  the  Eta  Chapter  (Yale).  Bros.  Arthur  B.  Waring,  '70,  and 
Albert  B.  Carlton,  '72,  founded  the  Iota  Chapter  and  another  Phi  brother 
participated  in  the  reestablishment  of  the  Beta  and  the  founding  of 
the  Alpha  Beta  Chapters.  The  chapter  has  entertained  the  Grand  Chap- 
ter several  times,  has  been  represented  by  delegates  at  every  one  of  the 
long  list  of  conventions  since  1847,  excepting  three,  Springfield,  1854, 
Cleveland,  1877,  and  Troy,  1879  (although  an  elder  was  present  at  the 
latter),  and  has  furnished  many  Grand  Officers  and  members  of  com- 
mittees who  were  active  and  efficient  in  their  several  positions. 

Bro.  W.  H.  Cooke,  '60,  with  J.  F.  Dripps,  '63,  prepared  the  amended 
constitution  which  was  adopted  in  1862  and  gave  expression  to  his  own 
spirit  as  well  as  that  of  Zeta  Psi,  *  in  the  resolutions  concerning  the 
brothers  who  were  engaged  in  theCivil  War.  Bros.  J.  Fred  Dripps,  '63,  E. 
P.  Sprague,  '64,  and  J.  J.  Rice,  '64,  revised  the  ritual  practically  as  it 
now  is  in  use.  Bros.  A.  H.  Gallatin,  '59,  and  A.  W.  Bailey,  '65,  were 
members  of  the  Committee  of  Publication  of  the  Catalogue  of  1867  and 
Bro.  Samuel  Marsh,  Jr.,  '67,  advanced  the  money  for  the  cost  of  it. 
Others  were  on  the  committees  on  the  last  revision  of  the  Constitution, 
the  Semicentennial  Song  Book,  the  Directory  of  '93,  and  the  Semicenten- 
nial Biographical  Catalogue.  Several  brothers  have  filled  offices  pro 
tern.,  notably  as  Sigma  Alpha,  Bro.  James  Boyd,  '82  (past  Sigma  Alpha) 
in  1891  and  Bro.  Freman  Woodbridge,  '89,  in  1892. 

Some  of  the  members  of  the  Chapter,  with  bright  promise  of  suc- 
cess and  usefulness,  have  been  taken  away  in  the  very  beginning  of 
their  careers.  The  first  one  was  Bro.  James  C.Watson, '50.  Hisfather's 
home  in  New  York  was  a  resort  of  the  literati  of  that  day,  Irving, 
Bryant,  Prescott  and  others.  After  the  delivery  of  his  commencement 
oration  Irving  presented  to  him  "a  beautiful  bouquet  of  roses  from  Sun-

nyside."  Prof.  Henry  M.  Baird  says  that  he  regarded  "Watson  as  the 
best  writer  in  the  class.  His  essays  were  capital,  hig-hly  imaginative 
and  very  entertaining."  He  chose  a  literary  career  but,  unfortunately, 
he  broke  down  in  health  and  died  Dec.  27,  1851. 

Among  the  latest  and  greatest  losses  which  the  Phi  Chapter,  as  well 
as  the  Fraternity,  has  met,  occurred  on  Feb.  19,  1897,  by  the  death  of  Bro. 
William  Alfred  Hoe,  Jr. ,  '88.  A  £  BK,  he  was  graduated  at  the  age  of  VJl/2 
years,  with  fourth  honor  and  the  degrees  of  B.  S.  and  C.  E.  Fidelity  to 
duty  and  affability  of  manner  gained  for  him  such  high  approval  that 
in  January,  1896,  being  a  little  over  twenty-six  years  of  age,  he  was  made 
a  member  of  the  firm  of  James  C.  Hoe's  Sons,  builders,  of  which  his 
father  was  the  head.  As  to  the  Chapter  he  was  ever  actively  and  prac- 
tically interested.  As  Sigma  Alpha,  1894-6,  he  has  never  been  surpassed 
as  to  the  conscientious  and  efficient  manner  in  which  he  did  every  part 
of  the  arduous  work  of  that  important  office.  He  was  a  member  of  the 
committee  on  the  Zeta  Psi  Directory  of  1893  and  (until  his  death)  on  this 
Semicentennial  Biographical  Catalogue  of  1899.  An  appropriate  and  a 
perpetual  monument  to  him  is  the  William  A.  Hoe,  Jr.,  Engineering 
Prize,  founded  at  New  York  University  by  his  father,  Mr.  William  A.  Hoe. 
Bro.  C.  C.  Crawford,  '91,  was  the  editor-in-chief  of  the  first  number 
of  the  Violet,  the  N.  Y.  U.  Annual.  Of  the  eleven  numbers  of  the  Violet, 
the  Phi  Chapter  has  had  the  editorship-in-chief  four  times.  In  1858  Bro. 
A.  A.  Redfield  was  the  chief  editor  of  a  paper  called  The  Item.  Thirty- 
six  years  later,  Bro.  J.  R.  Evans,  '98,  projected  and  for  four  years  was 
the  editor  of  a  weekly  by  the  same  name,  which,  in  1897,  was  changed  to 
The  Triangle.  Bro.  F.  W.  Carpenter,  '99,  was  chief  editor  in  his  Senior 
year.  Other  brothers  have  been  and  are  now  on  the  board  of  editors. 

In  athletics  the  brothers  have  always  been  actively  engaged.  Since 
1882  they  have  been  interested  in  lacrosse.  Bro.  C.  C.  Miller,  '88,  member 
of  N.  Y.  U.  Council,  was  recently  elected  president  of  the  Inter-University 
Lacrosse  Association.  Bro.  R.  B.  Keane,  captain  of  the '97  football  team, 
now  at  Yale  Medical  School,  was  on  the  Yale  '99  'varsity  football  team. 
In  the  intercollegiate  gymnastic  contest  at  University  Heights  in  1899, 
eighteen  colleges  being  represented,  Frank  J.  Belcher,  '00,  took  second 
prize  and  two  Yale  Zetes  took  third  and  fourth  prizes. 

There  is  not  space  to  mention  the  many  brothers  who  were  active  in 
chapter  affairs  during  the  fifties,  sixties,  seventies  and  eighties.  All 
honor  to  those  who  laid  the  foundation  and  to  those  who  built  the  super- 
structure, decade  by  decade,  loyal  to  and  fond  of  Zeta  Psi  to-day  as  when 
they  were  in  college.  The  brothers  of  the  nineties  maintained  at  Wash- 
ington Square  what  had  been  so  well  established,  and  then  cheerful  and 
hopeful,  undertook  to  perpetuate  their  rich  heritage  at  University  Heights. 
Recalling  the  very  small  beginnings  of  Zeta  Psi,  the  difficulties 
which  Bro.  Sommers  met  and  overcame  with  strong  faith  and  dauntless 
courage,  the  growth  from  the  trio  at  June  1,  1847,  in  one  chapter  to 
twenty-one  active  chapters  and  about  five  thousand  and  fifty  members  at 
the  present  time,  the  Phi  Chapter  rejoices  in  the  prosperity  and  strength 
of  the  chapters  and  the  Fraternity,  and  is  glad  to  see  the  modest  light 
of  the  dawning  developed  into  the  prophetic  "meridian  glory"  of  Zeta  Psi. 

Then  honor  it  in  feast  and  song 

And  bid  it  stand,  as  years  go  by, 

Full  ranked,  unrivaled,  firm  and  strong, 

The  brotherhood  of  Zeta  Psi.

existence  on  June  22,  1793.  It  is  situated  in  Williamstown,  Mass.,  three 
miles  from  the  northwest  corner  of  the  State,  and  a  Berkshire  town  famed 
for  scenery  and  the  beauties  of  nature.  The  town  and  college  are 
named  from  Col.  Ephraim  Williams,  an  old  Indian  fighter,  who  gave  by 
will,  money  to  be  used  in  forming  a  free  school  at  the  place  where  the 
college  now  stands.  There  are  usually  about  four  hundred  students  in 
its  four  classes,  and  it  has  no  departments  aside  from  its  regular  colle- 
giate work.  It  gives  but  one  degree  for  undergraduate  work,  that  of 
Bachelor  of  Arts,  the  whole  idea  and  aim  of  the  college  being  to  impart 
a  general  liberal  education  rather  than  a  specialized  one. 

The  Zeta  (originally  the  Alpha  of  Mass.)  Chapter  of  Zeta  Psi  was 
established  at  Williams  College  on  May  23,  1848.  One  of  its  founders 
was  John  Benjamin  Yates  Sommers,  the  originator  of  the  fraternity  and 
a  representative  of  the  Phi  Chapter.  The  other  two  were  George  S. 
Woodhull,  also  from  the  Phi,  and  Henry  Silas  Hodges,  who  had  been  ini- 
tiated a  few  days  before  and  was  a  Junior  in  Williams.  There  were 
four  fraternity  chapters  existing  in  the  college  at  that  time,  and  with 
them  the  Zeta  soon  took  a  place  of  strength  and  importance.  Eleven 
men  were  initiated  in  1848,  and  nine  in  the  year  following;  and  the  roll 
of  membership  included  several  who  attained  high  distinction  in  later 
years.  Among  them,  of  those  who  have  passed  away,  may  be  mentioned 
Hon.  Samuel  Barstow  Sumner,  clerk  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  Connecti- 
cut; Hon.  Addison  Cook  Niles,  Judge  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  California, 
and  Hon.  Phineas  Warriner  Hitchcock,  U.  S.  Senator  from  Nebraska 
during  1871-7. 

The  chapter  first  held  its  meetings  in  a  private  building  nearly  op- 
posite the  old  Union  House,  and  then  in  the  lodge  room  of  the  Odd  Fel- 
lows on  South  Street,  until  quarters  of  its  own,  consisting  of  a  hall  in 
one  of  the  buildings  at  the  foot  of  the  hill  below  East  College,  were 
finally  secured,  in  1850. 

In  spite  of  an  existence  so  well  begun,  and  so  greatly  assisted,  one 
would  think,  by  the  convention  of  Z  W  held  in  Williams,  August  14, 1849, 
the  Zeta's  early  history  was  somewhat  brief,  lasting  about  three  years, 
and  terminating  when  the  resignation  from  the  fraternity  was  presented 
and  accepted  in  Jthe  convention  of  1852.  This  untimely  cessation  of  a 
movement  promising  great  success  must  always  be  regarded  as  a  pro- 
nounced misfortune,  and  it  is  also  to  be  deplored  that  the  records  of  that 
interesting  period  have  been  lost.  It  is  known  that  in  1850  Bros.  Ezra 
Jones  Peck  and  John  Stewart  Barry  journeyed  to  Waterville,  Me.,  and 
assisted  in  bringing  the  Chi  Chapter  into  existence.  By  searching  in- 
quiry it  has  been  ascertained  that  the  passing  of  the  Zeta  was  the  out- 
come of  an  unfortunate  controversy  among  the  members,  the  exact  na- 
ture of  which,  after  so  many  years,  cannot  be  explained  with  confidence; 
but  aside  from  these  events,  together  with  the  others  already  given, 
and  the  handful  of  traditions  that  have  been  rescued,  no  further  historical 
material  is  at  hand.  In  connection  with  this,  however,  it  should  be  added 
that  in  the  light  of  the  fragmentary  information  available,  the  chief 
honors  apparently  belong  to  Henry  Silas  Hodges,  previously  mentioned, 
who  was  probably  the  leading  spirit  in  accomplishing  the  formation  of 
the  chapter;  and  the  fact  of  his  early  death,  only  two  years  later,  lends 
an  element  of  pathos  to  his  memory. 

In  1861  an  attempt  was  made  to  regain  the  charter,  but  it  met  with 
defeat,  the  refusal  being  grounded  on  the  belief  that  Williams  already 
had  as  many  fraternities  as  the  college  could  well  support.  Twenty 
years  later,  however,  there  dawned  an  era  which,  though  critical  and 


96  ZETA  CHAPTER 

anxious  at  the  start,  was  full  of  hopes,  which  have  since  been  abundantly 
realized.  In  1881  a  local  societj-  recently  formed  in  the  college,  petitioned 
for  a  chapter  of  Zeta  Psi,  and  Professor  Truman  Henry  Safford,  of  the 
Rho,  commended  the  petition  to  the  convention,  and  was  largely  instru- 
mental in  obtaining-  its  favorable  reception.  Bro.  Safford 's  invaluable 
assistance  at  this  time,  and  his  ever-constant  and  loyal  friendship  toward 
the  Zeta,  are  regarded  with  the  sincerest  gratitude.  On  November  21, 
1881,  Albert  Horatio  Gallatin  from  the  Phi,  D.  Cady  Gere  from  the 
Gamma,  Samuel  Barstow  Sumner  of  the  Zeta.,  Charles  Brown  Everson 
from  the  Psi,  and  Franklin  Haylander  Bowen,  Jr.,  from  the  Pi,  initiated 
the  petitioners,  and  again  the  Zeta  was  a  living  chapter.  The  names  of 
the  original  members  of  this  later  period  are  as  follows:  IraJewettGeer, 
John  Westfield  Gillette,  Francis  Lock  wood  Kendall,  Norman  Plass, 
George  Henry  Badger,  Frederick  Geller,  Frederick  Morris  Herrick, 
Charles  Kellogg  Ober,  Fred  De  Lysle  Smith,  Arthur  Francis  Winslow, 
Richard  Achilles  Ballinger,  William  Farrand  Livingston,  John  Corgell 
Parsons,  Edward  Ernest  Bradley,  Arthur  Day  Hawley,  William  Hall 
Poore  and  Walter  Bramhall  Sanford. 

To  this  list  new  names  were  soon  added,  and  the  Zeta.,  aided  by  a 
pleasant  relationship  with  the  Gamma  Chapter,  early  acquired  a  mature 
conception  of  its  new  responsibilities.  The  history  of  its  eighteen  years 
up  to  the  present  time  is  most  gratifying.  The  Zeta's  success,  starting 
from  the  wise  and  vigorous  policy  of  the  men  who  effected  the  reestablish- 
ment,  has  been  rapid  and  yet  normal;  and  though  the  total  membership 
is  not  large,  numbering  in  all  but  178,  of  which  143  are  of  the  later 
period,  the  chapter  has  developed  a  strong  vitality,  and  the  steadily  in- 
creasing ranks  of  graduates  are  giving  it  their  loyal  and  substantial 
support.  Two  alumni  associations  are  already  in  existence,  one  in  New 
York  City,  with  eight  or  ten  years  to  its  credit,  and  the  other  in  western 
New  York,  organized  in  1896. 

The  chapter,  since  its  revival,  has  occupied  two  houses  in  succession, 
the  first  being  a  small  building  facing  the  Field  Park,  which  it  found 
necessary  to  leave,  in  1890,  for  the  commodious  dwelling  which  serves 
as  its  present  home.  This  is  a  building  of  pleasing  architecture  which 
stands  in  a  most  desirable  position,  on  North  Street,  commanding  from 
its  windows  and  piazzas  an  extensive  view  of  the  Berkshire  Hills. 

This  brief  history  of  the  Zeta  can  close  perhaps  in  no  better  way 
than  with  a  list  of  its  members  who  have  had  the  honor  of  holding  Grand 
Chapter  offices.  Their  names  are  as  follows:  Charles  Allen  Sumner,  5?  A; 
Henry  Axtell,  A  $  A;  Charles  Abbott  Stowell,  A  $  A;  Ezra.  Jones  Peck, 
A  $A,2A;  Thomas  Gillfillan,  2  A;  Walter  Anson  Weed,  Jr.,  A  2  A-, 
Samuel  Barstow  Sumner,  2  p  A.

HISTORY   OF  THE   DELTA  CHAPTER 

RUTGERS  COLLEGE  was  one  of  the  eight  colleges  founded  before  the 
Revolution,  its  first  charter  having  been  granted  by  Gov.  Franklin  of 
New  Jersey,  on  Nov.  10,  1766.  An  amended  charter  was  granted  in 
1770,  under  which  it  began  active  work.  Its  primary  object  was  to  fit 
men  living  in  America  for  the  Ministry;  and  secondarily  to  give  in- 
struction in  the  Liberal  Arts.  At  times  in  its  early  history  its  exercises 
were  suspended,  but  it  has  continued  uninterruptedly  since  1325,  when 
also  its  name  was  changed  from  "Queen's"  to  "Rutgers"  in  honor 
of  Col.  Henry  Rutgers,  a  liberal  benefactor.  In  1865  it  was  made  the 
State  College  "for  the  benefit  of  Agriculture  and  the  Mechanic  Arts." 
At  about  the  same  time  the  religious  instruction  was  taken  away  from 
the  College  and  given  to  the  New  Brunswick  Theological  Seminary. 
The  two  departments  of  Rutgers  now  are — the  College  or  Classical 
School,  and  the  Scientific  School. 

At  two  o'clock  on  the  afternoon  of  November  24,  1848,  Judson  Hawley 
Hopkins  and  John  Hess,  two  students  of  Rutgers  College,  in  the  class 
of  1850,  entered  the  house  at  184  Henry  Street,  New  York  City,  where 
Hopkins'  intimate  friend  and  cousin,  George  S.  Woodhull,  Phi  '48, 
lived.  Their  purpose  was  secret,  the  result  momentous,  for  there 
in  Woodhull 's  house  they  were  initiated  into  the  rites  and  mysteries 
of  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity.  Bro.  Hopkins  was  the  thirteenth  initi- 
ate into  the  Fraternity  of  Zeta  Psi,  and  was  received  by  the  members 
of  the  "Alpha  of  New  York,"  the  parent  and  present  Phi  Chapter. 
In  January,  1849,  Bro.  Hopkins  and  Bro.  Hess  added  to  their  number 
from  the  students  at  Rutgers,  Cortlandt  Van  Wyck,  '50,  and  Charles 
Matthews,  '50.  These  four  made  up  the  charter  members.  On  January 
15,  1849,  a  petition  was  read  in  the  "Alpha  of  New  York,"  signed  by 
these  four  students,  asking  that  a  chapter  be  formally  established  at 
Rutgers.  Heretofore  they  had  to  journey  to  New  York  to  attend  the 
meetings  there,  an  inconvenient  and  suspicious  proceeding.  With  the 
consent  of  the  "Alpha  of  Massachusetts,"  the  Williams  College  Chapter, 
now  the  Zeta  Chapter,  the  petition  was  granted,  and  a  committee  of  one 
(Bro.  Woodhull)  was  appointed  to  determine  upon  the  ceremonies  to  be 
used  at  the  installation  of  the  "Alpha  of  New  Jersey."  This  took  place 
shortly  after,  for  the  first  meeting  of  the  new  chapter  was  held  on  Jan- 
uary 22,  1849.  Later  in  the  year  Matthews  left  college  and  was  dropped 
from  the  chapter  roll,  and  Peter  WTarren  Rousse,  '50,  the  fifth  initiate, 
was  chosen  to  take  his  place  among  the  charter  members.  On  October  20, 
1851,  in  accordance  with  the  action  taken  in  the  Grand  Chapter  of  1851, 
the  Rutgers  Chapter  took  to  itself  the  name  of  "Delta"  instead  of 
"Alpha  of  New  Jersey.  " 

The  most  important  institutions  at  Rutgers  in  those  days  were  the 
two  great  literary  societies,  the  Philoclean  and  Peithosophian.  Every 
student  was  a  member  of  one  of  these.  To  prevent  what  has  since  taken 
place,  i.  e.,  that  the  Greek  Letter  Fraternities  should  supersede  these 
rival  societies,  Philo  had  passed  a  law  that  only  five  of  its  members 
could  be  also  members  of  a  Greek  Letter  Fraternity.  Bros.  Hopkins, 
Hess  and  Van  Wyck  were  all  members  of  Peitho,  and,  on  account  of  the

intense  rivalry,  could  not  seek  for  Zetes  among  Philocleans.  However, 
they  won  Peter  Warren  Rousse,  '50,  who  made  it  a  condition  of  joining 
that  four  of  his  intimate  friends  and  associates,  who  were  Philocleans, 
should  also  be  received.  This,  of  course,  was  gladly  assented  to,  and 
Richard  Ludlow  Larremore,  '50,  Garret  C.  Schenck,  '51,  Oliver  H.  Hoff- 
man, '51,  and  Charles  H.  Skillman,  '51,  were  shortly  after  initiated  into 
Zeta  Psi.  Thus  only  five  Philocleans  were  Zetes,  and  by  this  living  up 
to  the  letter  of  the  law,  the  Delta  Chapter  obtained  favor  among  the 
students.  Two  more  students  from  Peitho  were  initiated  when  college 
opened,  and  in  the  fall  of  1849  the  chapter  started  on  its  first  j'ear  of 
active  work  with  ten  members.  As  an  example  of  the  high  standard  of 
these  early  Zetes,  we  might  mention  that  at  the  Junior  Exhibition  in 
June,  1849,  five  out  of  the  eight  orators  on  that  occasion  were  Zetes. 
Zeal  for  Zeta  Psi  characterized  these  pioneers,  for  during  the  first 
decade  ninety-four  men  were  initiated,  and  the  chapter  was  always  full  to 
thelimit.  It  was  not  until  twenty-four  years  later,  in  1884,  that  two  hundred 
had  been  enrolled.  "Of  the  first  one  hundred  less  than  half  are  living, 
but  how  far  above  the  average  has  been  their  success  in  life !  About 
forty  became  lawyers,  of  whom  a  dozen  rose  to  high  judicial  station; 
sixteen  entered  the  ministry,  all  but  two  of  whom  became  Doctors  of 
Divinity ;  sixteen  became  physicians  and  among  the  most  distinguished 
in  the  land ;  a  dozen  chose  mercantile  careers,  and  ten  were  farmers, 
and  in  every  case  have  been  influential  for  good. " 

During  the  Civil  War  no  less  than  eighteen  men  served  as  officers 
in  the  Union  Army  or  Navy  and  nine  in  the  Confederate,  making  a  total 
of  twenty-seven  Delta  men  who  would  have  cheerfully  given  their  lives 
for  what  they  thought  was  right ;  six  of  these  did  so.  During  our  more 
recent  war,  Bro.  James  Parker,  '74,  Lieutenant-Colonel  of  the  Twelfth 
N.  Y.  Volunteer  Infantry,  did  his  part  in  rescuing  Cuba.  A  private  in 
his  command  wrote  in  his  letter  home  of  the  trials  of  camp  life,  of  the 
inefficiency  of  some  officers,  and  of  the  longing  of  the  men  for  active 
service.  "And,"  he  went  on  to  say,  "when  it  comes,  the  Twelfth  Regi- 
ment will  make  a  record  beyond  the  others,  for  we  have  the  best  com- 
mander in  the  service,  and  the  boys  will  follow  on  through  hell  should 
Col.  Parker  lead  the  way."  When  the  war  closed,  Bro.  Parker  was 
honorably  discharged,  but  was  afterwards  appointed  Lieut. -Col.  of  the 
45th  U.  S.  Volunteers. 

Secret  societies  were  not  in  favor  at  Rutgers  during  the  fifties.  The 
Alumni,  Trustees  and  Faculty  all  frowned  upon  them,  and  passed 
resolutions  and  by-laws  restricting  and  prohibiting  them.  Solution  of 
knotty  problems  was  the  order  of  the  day  for  such  as  swore  allegiance 
to  them.  Nothing  introduced  by  the  college  authorities  availed,  how- 
ever, and  with  the  death  of  President  Frelinghuysen  in  1862,  the  old 
order  of  things  passed  away.  President  Campbell  saw  that  it  was  a 
losing  fight  and  abolished  the  restrictive  bans.  As  a  consequence,  a 
number  of  secret  leagues,  societies  and  brotherhoods  were  formed,  and 
petitions  were  sent  to  the  larger  fraternities  for  charters.  Owing  to  the 
Civil  War,  the  enrollment  of  students  was  very  small,  with  a  consequent 
reduction  in  the  membership  of  the  chapter. 

These  two  factors,  as  well  as  internal  dissensions,  brought  about 
the  first  crisis  of  the  Delta  Chapter,  which  may  be  dated  1866.  The 
number  of  initiates  had  been  steadily  dropping;  for  various  reasons  the 
membership  was  depleted,  and  at  that  time,  affairs  reached  such  a 
climax  that  two  members  were  expelled.  Others  tendered  their  resigna- 
tions, but  later  withdrew  them.  This  transitional  and  critical  period 
of  1861-1867  was  a  direct  result  of  the  great  conflict  of  opinions  going  on 
in  our  political  life.  Both  the  college  and  the  fraternity  felt  it.  New 
views  of  life  were  presented,  and  it  was  not  strange  that  the  young 
minds  of  the  collegians  should  be  driven  asunder  by  differences.  Yet 
the  spirit  of  Zeta  Psi  held  fast  her  members,  and  the  dissensions  within 
were  not  disclosed  to  the  outer  world.  The  staunch  vessel  weathered 


DELTA  CHAPTER  123 

the  gale,  and  with  a  new  crew  and  pilot  set  forth  with  fair  weather  upon 
her  second  voyage.  There  can  be  no  doubt  that  the  pilot  of  that  time 
was  Bro.  George  Sharpe  Duryee,  of  the  class  of  1872,  a  man  who  has  left 
the  impress  of  his  character  upon  his  fraternity,  college  and  State. 
With  a  band  of  earnest,  capable  men,  he  soon  had  restored  the  former 
prestige  of  Zeta  Psi,  until  it  was  without  a  rival  in  the  college.  From 
1867-1874,  forty  Brothers  were  initiated,  against  twenty-six  during  the  pre- 
vious seven  years. 

Everything  in  college  life  was  in  Zete  hands.  Targum  Editors, 
Boat  Club  Directors,  Class  Presidents,  Head  Ushers,  etc.,  were  usually 
Zeta  Psis.  The  College  Annual,  The  Scarlet  Letter,  was  originated 
and  published  by  the  Zetes,  with  Bro.  G.  S.  Duryee  as  the  first  editor- 
in-chief.  Class-day  exercises  had  been  revived  and  ruled  by  them. 
After  the  graduation  of  the  class  of  1872,  however,  their  grip  slackened 
through  carelessness  and  overconfidence.  The  story  of  their  first  fight 
is  thus  told  by  Bro.  J.  R.  Duryee,  '74: 

"At  the  beginning  of  the  fall  term  that  year  (1872),  a  mighty  coali- 
tion of  the  other  fraternities  was  formed  to  overwhelm  us.  The  first 
great  event  was  the  election  of  Targum  Editors.  As  went  this  election, 
so  would  we  stand  in  public  opinion  for  many  a  long  day.  And  it  was 
Zeta  Psi  against  the  field.  We  hastily  tried  to  build  our  fences,  but 
they  would  not  hold.  All  the  morning  most  of  us  spent  the  precious 
hours  in  buttonholing,  cajoling,  bribing  and  threatening  the  elusive 
neutrals,  only  to  realize  that  the  hated  opposition  had  seduced  them  from 
their  proper  guides.  But  where  was  Howard  Fuller?  For  three  long 
days  and  nights  he  had  mysteriously  absented  himself  from  hall  and 
rooms,  nor  taken  any  into  his  confidence.  At  the  close  of  recitations, 
the  voting  was  to  be  by  classes  in  the  chapel.  In  the  dark  moment  when 
the  last  Sophomores  were  passing  out,  and  our  foes  were  gloating 
because  of  what  seemed  an  assured  triumph,  the  tramping  of  a  host  was 
heard,  and  the  entire  Freshman  class,  numbering  nearly  half  the 
college,  led  by  Fuller,  entered.  Each  in  turn  took  from  him  a  ballot 
which  was  deposited;  and  the  benediction  of  his  smile  was  a  sufficient 
recompense.  And  so  we  won  the  day.  Talk  of  Stalky  and  Co. !  Why 
Howard  Fuller  could  give  points  to  the  best  of  Kipling's  heroes  and  then 
conjure  the  lot  of  them  out  of  sight." 

In  1874  ten  members  were  graduated,  leaving  but  five  in  the  chapter  and 
a  large  debt.  They  had  almost  reached  the  bottom,  and  the  uphill  fight 
became  hard  and  difficult.  The  college  was  small,  and  the  rivalry  of 
the  five  fraternities  fierce;  hence  the  membership  during  these  years 
was  never  large,  while  the  load  of  the  debt  seemed  enormous.  But  the 
needed  man  came;  and  the  name  of  Bro.  Jonathan  Bruen  Miller, '79,  will 
be  remembered  while  the  Delta  shall  stand.  Ceaseless  activity  for 
Zeta  Psi  marked  the  eight  years  of  his  connection  with  it,  from  1875 
until  his  death.  Through  his  personal  work,  the  debt  incurred  was 
removed,  and  the  first  half  of  this  trying  period,  well-called  the  "Storm 
and  Stress"  period  of  the  chapter,  was  successfully  passed. 

Again  did  the  numbers  decrease  until  in  1883  only  three  active  mem- 
bers were  left  in  the  chapter,  and  the  fear  of  suspension  stared  them  in 
the  face.  But  Bro.  John  Laubenheimer,  '83,  had  been  graduated  that  spring 
and  had  entered  the  New  Brunswick  Theological  Seminary;  so  that  he 
was  at  hand  to  aid.  This  minimum  membership  also  roused  up  that 
famous  body  of  "Newark  Alumni,"  who  assisted  the  struggling  chapter 
in  many  ways.  Bro.  Laubenheimer 's  work  was  crowned  with  success, 
for  among  the  first  initiates  was  Bro.  Warren  J.  Brodie,  '87.  To  his 
inspiring  work  is  due  the  rise  from  this  third  crisis  to  the  flood  tide  of 
prosperity  which  existed  in  '89  and  '90.  Bro.  Brodie  was  a  most  earnest 
and  convincing  talker,  and  he  used  this  talent  for  his  fraternity.  Dr. 
Wm.  V.  V.  Mabon  once  said:  "Brodie,  if  you  would  enter  the  ministry 
and  work  as  hard  for  the  church  as  you  do  for  Zeta  Psi  you  would  make 
the  Devil  bestir  himself. "  As  an  example  of  his  work  and  its  result, 


124  DELTA  CHAPTER 

we  may  state  that  he  joined  the  chapter  when  it  was  three  in  number; 
he  left  it  twenty-one  strong. 

The  years  '86-'92  were  the  most  progressive  in  the  chapter's 
history,  for  during  then  it  left  rented  rooms  and  entered  a  house  of 
its  own.  The  meetings  also  were  well  attended  and  sustained ; 
the  members  enjoyed  an  unexcelled  social  position  and  a  high  rank 
in  college  affairs;  and  among  them  were  some  prize-winners.  Later 
the  membership  decreased  until  in  1897  there  were  but  nine  under- 
graduate Brothers.  This  crisis  is  now  happily  passed.  Great  credit 
should  be  given  to  certain  of  the  younger  alumni,  who,  through  all 
these  depressing  years,  have  continued  unfaltering  in  their  encour- 
agement and  advice,  and  have  spurred  the  lagging  Brothers  to 
the  work. 

One  organization  in  connection  with  the  chapter  must  be  spoken  of. 
In  1877  a  circular  signed  by  Bros.  Peter  Warren  Rousse,  'SO,  William 
Stoddard,  '74,  Edward  H.  Duryee,  '76,  Cortlandt  Parker,  Jr.,  '78,  and 
J.  Bruen  Miller,  '79,  was  sent  around  among  the  Elders  in  order  to  form 
an  Alumni  Association.  In  December,  1878,  the  Alumni  Association  of 
the  Delta  Chapter  of  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity  was  organized,  and  regular 
meetings  have  been  held  at  Commencement  time  since  then.  In  1889,  five 
Trustees  were  elected  to  procure  a  chapter  house,  and  proper  steps  for 
the  purchase  of  one  were  taken.  The  present  house,  at  18  College 
Avenue,  was  bought  by  these  Trustees  and  the  grounds  fitted  up. 

But  I  am  anticipating.  Up  to  this  time  no  record  has  been  made  of 
the  different  places  of  meeting  of  the  Delta  Chapter.  To  make  this  his- 
tory valuable  in  one  respect  at  least,  a  careful  research  on  this  subject 
has  been  made,  and  the  following  list  of  housings  is  submitted: 

From  November  24,  1848,  to  May  1,  1851,  there  was  no  regular 
meeting-place.  The  chapter  met  in  the  rooms  of  the  students,  or  in 
rooms  hired  for  the  night,  or  at  times  in  the  college  building  itself. 
Soon,  however,  the  need  of  a  permanent  room  was  felt,  and  they  procured 
a  hall  at  the  corner  of  Peace  and  Albany  Streets,  the  first  contract  for 
which  reads  thus: 

"I  hereby  lease  to  Robert  S.  Manning  and  John  F.  Talmadge,  a 
committee  of  the  Zeta  Psi  Society  of  Rutgers  College,  the  room  situated 
in  the  third  story  of  my  house,  to  hold  in  their  possession  for  society  pur- 
poses for  one  year  from  May  1,  1851,  for  the  sum  of  $15,  in  quarterly 
instalments,  and  do  also  give  them  the  right  to  place  there  such  conve- 
nience for  fire  as  may  be  necessary. — Henry  Wiley." 

The  chapter  remained  there  for  nine  years,  until  1860.  One  great 
advantage  of  the  room  was  its  accessibility,  for  an  outside  stair,  although 
steep,  led  to  its  entrance.  From  this  modest,  yet  pleasant  apartment 
they  went  to  the  Algonquin  Lodge  Room,  in  Liberty  Street,  between 
George  and  Neilson,  where  the  Masons  met.  They  remained  there  four 
years,  until  once  again  they  wanted  rooms  of  their  own.  This  time  they 
rented  a  room  on  the  third  floor  of  the  Parsons  Building,  at  15  Church 
Street.  They  began  occupancy  there  September  12,  1864,  and  continued 
until  1880.  Thus  memories  of  sixteen  years  hover  about  this  meeting- 
room.  In  the  fall  of  1880  they  rented  rooms  at  9  and  11  Peace  Street. 
These  were  on  the  third  floor  of  the  Frankenstein  Building.  Ward's 
drygoods  store  was  below,  the  Young  Men's  Catholic  Club  occupied  the 
second  floor,  and  the  Jewish  Synagogue  was  in  the  rear.  There  were 
two  rooms,  one  large,  the  other  small,  and  the  Brothers  took  turns  in 
caring  for  them.  They  met  there  for  three  years. 

The  large  Masonic  Hall  which  had  recently  been  built  at  the  corner 
of  George  and  Albany  Streets  offered  very  desirable  quarters,  so  they 
moved  to  Room  13,  on  the  third  floor,  in  September,  1883.  There  were 
really  two  rooms,  a  large  one  and  a  small  one.  The  latter  was  used  as 
a  lodge-room,  but  it  was  too  small,  and  the  meetings  always  overflowed 
into  the  larger  one.  On  February  1,  1888,  the  chapter  moved  down  to 
Rooms  6,  7  and  8,  on  the  second  floor.  Here  there  were  three  rooms 


DELTA  CHAPTER  125 

instead  of  two.  The  first  was  used  as  a  billiard-room,  the  second  as  a 
general  gathering  and  reception  room,  and  the  third  was  the  lodge-room. 
All  three  were  of  equal  size  and  were  entered  by  a  single  door  leading 
from  one  into  the  other. 

The  question  of  a  chapter  house  had  long  been  considered.  It  was 
now  found  especially  needful  since  Delta  Phi  had  built.  Just  at  this 
time  a  large  piece  of  property  on  College  Avenue,  across  the  street  from 
the  college,  was  offered  for  sale  at  an  exceptionally  low  figure.  The 
house  on  it  had  been  built  about  1862.  Later  its  owner,  ex-Mayor 
Marvin  J.  Merchant,  enlarged  it  by  adding  an  entire  right  wing. 
During  the  summer  of  1889  the  Trustees  already  mentioned  bought  the 
whole  piece  of  property.  Subscriptions  were  immediately  raised  and  the 
first  payment  was  made  in  cash.  The  frontage  on  Easton  Avenue,  which 
was  of  no  use  to  the  chapter,  was  sold,  and  a  mortgage  of  $5,000  was 
left.  The  Alumni  Association  have  reduced  this  gradually  in  the  last 
ten  years,  and  it  will  not  be  long  before  the  whole  will  be  wiped  out. 

The  property  has  a  frontage  on  College  Avenue  of  100  feet  and 
extends  back  300  feet,  giving  ample  room  for  a  fine  tennis  court,  sur- 
rounded by  numerous  old  cherry -trees,  which  give  abundant  shade  and 
fruit  in  season.  The  house  itself  is  substantially  built  and  originally 
cost  a  great  deal.  It  is  a  double  frame  structure,  a  large  hallway  on  the 
main  floor  extending  the  length  of  the  house  and  opening  on  a  back 
porch.  On  the  right  is  one  large,  long  room,  which  is  used  as  a  billiard 
and  general  gathering  room.  On  the  left  are  two  smaller  rooms,  the 
front,  the  reception-room  and  library,  the  rear,  the  dining-room.  On  the 
second  floor  are  comfortable  and  convenient  sleeping-rooms  for  the 
Brothers  living  in  the  house;  there  being  accommodations  for  eight  or  ten. 
The  lodge-room  is  conveniently  located  for  its  purposes.  The  chapter 
moved  in  during  August,  1889,  and  the  house  was  handsomely  fitted  up. 
On  May  9,  1890,  the  housewarming  was  given,  the  most  brilliant  social 
success  of  the  college.  Since  then  dances  have  every  year  been  held  in 
the  house,  which  is  admirably  adapted  for  such  events.  In  fact,  ours  is 
the  only  fraternity  house  in  the  college  which  can  comfortably  accom- 
modate large  companies.* 

The  Delta  Chapter  has  always  been  active  for  the  Fraternity.  It 
spread  the  good  news  of  Zeta  Psi  abroad  to  other  colleges.  Bro.  Peter 
Warren  Rousse,  '50,  full  of  zeal  for  the  infant  Zeta  Psi,  started  on  a 
campaign  of  chapter-founding.  On  May  14,  1850,  Jonathan  Longstreet, 
a  Princeton  student  of  the  class  of  1850,  was  initiated  at  New  Bruns- 
wick, and  on  June  3, 1850,  five  others  came  up  from  Princeton  and  joined 
our  Fraternity.  This  was  the  inception  of  the  Omicron  Chapter,  the  Beta 
of  New  Jersey.  On  July  8,  1850,  Edward  W.  and  Samuel  E.  Appleton, 
then  attending  the  University  of  Pennsylvania,  came  to  New  Brunswick 
and  were  initiated  into  the  rites  and  ceremonies  of  Zeta  Psi,  and  re- 
turned to  their  University.  Shortly  after  Bro.  Rousse  and  Bro.  J.  B. 
Yates  Sommers,  Phi  '49,  the  founder  of  Zeta  Psi,  initiated  the  charter 
members  of  the  Sigma  at  the  University  of  Pennsylvania.  Subse- 
quently the  Appleton  brothers  came  back  and  were  graduated  at  Rutgers. 
In  1852  Bro.  Rousse  and  Bro.  Edward  Appleton,  '52,  were  instrumental 
in  the  starting  of  the  Chapter  at  Brown ;  and  while  attending  the  Law 
School  at  Harvard,  Bro.  Rousse  received  the  authority  and  initiated 
the  members  of  the  Rho  Chapter  at  Harvard.  Later,  in  1858,  the  charter

126  DELTA  CHAPTER 

members  of  the  Upsilon  were  initiated  by  the  Delta,  and  it  was  largely 
due  to  the  efforts  of  Bro.  R.  A.  Anthony,  Delta  '81,  and  Bro.  C.  W. 
Cutler,  Delta  '79,  that  the  Alpha  Chapter  was  established  at  Columbia 
in  1879. 

Owing-  to  the  small  membership  in  newly  founded  fraternities,  the 
earlier  chapters  gained  a  preponderance  of  Grand  Chapter  Officers, 
many  Delta  men  being  numbered  among  them. 

The  Delta  has  many  valuable  documents  in  its  possession.  Treasure 
after  treasure  has  been  dug  forth  from  its  richly  laden  archives ;  for  a 
time  it  guarded  the  Omicron  Chapter  minutes  and  letters ;  while  Grand 
Chapter  minutes,  old  letters,  constitutions,  and  initiation  services — docu- 
mentary history  which  is  priceless — have  been  gathered  and  kept  through 
these  many  years,  until  now  it  has  been  filed  and  safely  stored  by  Bro. 
H.  M.  Waldron,  '93. 

During  these  fifty  years,  two  hundred  and  sixty-seven  Brothers  have 
been  initiated  into  the  Delta  Chapter.  Of  these  sixty-four  have  become 
lawyers;  thirty-four,  physicians;  thirty,  ministers.  The  others,  not 
seeking  these  professional  callings,  have  interested  themselves  in  various 
businesses  and  manufactures.  Seventy-five  only  have  crossed  to  join 
the  choir  invisible,  leaving  a  body  of  Elders,  numbering  nearly  two 
hundred,  staunch,  true  and  loyal  Zetes. 

It  is  but  right  that  we  should  mention  one  name  dear  to  the  heart  of 
every  Delta  Zete.  Bro.  William  Rankin  Duryee,  D.D.,  '56,  truly  showed 
in  his  life,  character,  and  deeds  the  great  principles  of  Tau  Kappa  Phi. 
A  good  Zete,  an  honest  citizen,  a  noble  Christian,  he  was  an  inspiration 
and  a  help  to  his  younger  Brothers  during  all  his  connection  with  the 
Delta,  and  was  ever  a  welcome  guest  within  our  chapter  halls.  He 
always  had  the  "Zete  House"  in  mind,  and  great  was  the  assistance  he 
gave  us.  The  tokens  of  his  affection  adorn  our  walls,  the  benediction  of 
his  noble  face  falls  upon  our  gatherings  in  the  great  long  room,  and  his 
memory  shall  ever  be  fresh  as  we  sing  his  classic  hymn : 

"Zeta  Psi,  we  pledge  to-night 
Evermore  to  love  thee. " 

And  that  is  the  resolve  of  the  Delta  Chapter  as  it  enters  upon  its 
second  half  century.

HISTORY  OF  THE  OMICRON  CHAPTER 

Princeton  University  ranks  fourth  in  order  of  founding  among  Ameri- 
can colleges.  It  received  its  charter  in  1746  from  John  Hamilton,  presi- 
dent of  His  Majesty's  Council,  and  was  established  "for  the  intellectual 
and  religious  culture  of  youth  desirous  to  obtain  a  liberal  education, 
and  more  especially  for  the  thorough  training  of  such  as  were  candidates 
for  the  ministry."  The  college  was  opened  in  May,  1747,  at  Elizabeth, 
under  the  presidency  of  the  Rev.  John  Dickinson,  who  died  in  October, 
and  was  succeeded  by  Rev.  Aaron  Burr.  A  second  and  more  liberal 
charter  was  granted  the  college  in  1848,  equal  advantages  and  privi- 
leges being  given  to  members  of  every  denomination  of  Christians.  On 
the  death  of  its  first  president  the  seat  of  the  college  was  removed  from 
Elizabeth  to  Newark,  the  residence  of  the  second  president,  where  it 
remained  until  1757,  when  it  was  removed  to  Princeton,  on  securing  the 
erection  there  of  Nassau  Hall  (named  in  memory  of  William  III.).  This 
is  the  oldest  college  building,  and  was  erected  in  1756.  Those  who 
received  the  original  charter  and  who  built  up  the  college  were  connected 
with  the  New  York  Presbyterian  Synod,  but  no  organic  connection  with 
Presbyterianism  was  adopted.  From  1766  Presbyterians  generally 
united  in  support  of  the  college,  and  in  1812  the  General  Seminary  estab- 
lished its  Theological  Seminary  at  Princeton,  though  the  latter  is  uncon- 
nected with  the  college.  Nassau  Hall  has  been  famous  in  the  historical 
annals  of  the  United  States.  During  the  Revolution  it  was  occupied 
by  the  American  and  the  British  troops  as  barracks,  and  also  as  a 
hospital.  In  1783  the  Continental  Congress  met  in  the  hall.  In  the  same 
year  the  college  commencement  was  attended  by  Washington  and  the 
members  of  Congress,  at  which  time  Washington  presented  the  college 
with  a  donation  for  damages  inflicted  upon  the  building  during  the  war. 

By  means  of  donations  from  numerous  liberal  benefactors  the  institu- 
tion has  gradually  extended,  libraries,  museums,  laboratories,  observa- 
tories, a  commencement  hall  of  great  beauty  and  elaborately  fitted 
athletic  fields  and  gymnasium  having  been  added.  The  college  grounds 
now  cover  225  acres,  adorned  with  lawns,  fine  old  elms  and  handsome 
buildings.  Most  of  the  students  live  on  the  campus  in  dormitories 
which  furnish  excellent  accommodations.  Under  the  administration  of 
Dr.  McCosh  the  college  reached  its  present  dimensions  and  importance. 
Dr.  McCosh  was  succeeded  by  Francis  Landey  Patton.  D.D.,  LL.D., 
who  was  inaugurated  in  1888.  In  1899-1900  there  were  85  instructors 
and  1,100  students. 

Early  in  the  history  of  the  Greek-letter  fraternities  Princeton  was 
recognized  as  a  field  for  the  extension  of  chapters.  As  early  as  1843  an 
attempt  was  made  to  establish  a  chapter,  which,  however,  had  a  short 
life  of  three  years;  a  second  attempt  in  1845  met  with  better  success,  the 
chapter  existing  until  1857,  when  it  was  suspended  on  account  of  faculty 
opposition.  The  third  fraternity  to  establish  a  chapter  at  Princeton 
was  Zeta  Psi,  in  1850.  The  records  and  correspondence  show  that  for 
over  a  quarter  of  a  century  the  existence  and  organization  of  the  chap- 
ter at  Princeton  were  maintained  in  the  face  of  much  opposition  and 
discouragement.  Of  twelve  fraternities  which  had  chapters  at  Prince- 
ton, Zeta  Psi  was  maintained  for  the  longest  time.  The  Omicron  Chap- 
ter owes  its  existence  principally  to  the  activity  of  the  Delta  Chapter  at 
Rutgers.  Jonathan  Longstreet,  a  student  at  Princeton,  was  initiated 
a  member  of  the  fraternity  by  the  Rutgers  Chapter  May  14,  1850,  and 
immediately  started  to  pledge  men  for  a  chapter  at  Princeton.  The 
chapter  was  formally  established  by  the  initiation  at  New  Brunswick, 
June  3,  1850,  of  William  Bull,  Barnes  Compton,  Hugh  William  Henry, 
Edwards  Caldwell  Heyer  and  Alexander  Hamilton  Phillips,  all  of  the 


164  OMICRON  CHAPTER 

class  of  '51.  No  further  initiations  were  held  until  the  spring  of  the 
next  year,  at  which  time  the  membership  was  increased  by  the  addition 
of  twelve  men,  chosen  from  all  classes,  the  Sophomore,  Junior  and 
Senior. 

With  the  exception  of  the  first  few  years  of  the  history  of  the 
Omicron,  the  membership  was  small,  seldom  exceeding  a  dozen  men. 
Soon  after  its  establishment  a  successful  growth  was  hampered  by  the 
stringent  laws  adopted  by  the  college  authorities  against  Greek-letter 
fraternities.  The  organization  was,  however,  maintained  in  the  expec- 
tation that  the  opposition,  not  at  this  time  confined  to  Princeton,  would 
cease,  and  the  fraternity  system  would  be  recognized  as  part  of  the  life 
of  the  college  community.  Under  Dr.  McCosh's  administration,  the  oppo- 
sition, instead  of  diminishing,  became  more  severe;  the  continued  existence 
of  the  chapter,  even  in  secret,  became  unwise;  faculty  action  made  mem- 
bership of  the  college  and  of  a  fraternity  at  Princeton  absolutely  incom- 
patible. The  chapter  in  December,  1875,  disbanded  as  an  affiliated 
member  of  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity.  In  the  expectation  that  a  reversal 
of  the  attitude  of  the  college  authorities  might  enable  the  fraternity  to 
continue  at  Princeton,  the  Grand  Chapter,  at  its  meeting  held  in  Phila- 
delphia, July  12,  1876,  authorized  the  Delta,  Sigma  and  Tau  Chapters 
to  initiate  into  the  fraternity  Princeton  students  duly  elected  and  offi- 
cially presented  by  the  members  of  the  fraternity  at  Princeton.  The 
fraternity  thus  continued  for  a  number  of  years  to  be  represented  by 
members  initiated  at  other  chapters.  Conditions,  however,  remaining 
unfavorable,  it  was  voted  at  the  Grand  Chapter  meeting  at  Syracuse,  Jan- 
uary, 1882,  that  the  Omicron  Chapter  be  honorably  discontinued  as  an 
active  chapter.  A  few  men  were  initiated  by  the  Sigma  Chapter  after 
this  date  under  the  authority  conferred  by  the  action  of  1876.  This  privi- 
lege was  soon  withdrawn  and  all  attempts  at  securing  representation  at 
Princeton  ended  with  the  class  of  1887.

HISTORY  OF  THE  SIGMA  CHAPTER. 

To  "The  Publick  Academy  in  the  City  of  Philadelphia,"  founded 
November  13,  1749,  chartered  on  July  13,  1753,  by  the  Colonial  Pro- 
prietors as  "The  Academy  and  Charitable  School  in  the  Province 
of  Pennsylvania,"  and  on  June  16,  1755,  as  "The  College,  Academy  and 
Charitable  School  of  Philadelphia,"  and  its  later  created  (September 
27,  1799)  rival  and  intended  successor,  "The  University  of  the  State  of 
Pennsylvania,"  when  united  by  an  act  of  the  General  Assembly  of 
Pennsylvania  of  September  30,  1791,  the  present  University  of  Pennsyl- 
vania traces  its  foundation. 

It  has  been  located  for  by  far  the  major  portion  of  its  existence  at 
but  two  places — from  1802  to  1872  at  the  northwest  corner  of  Ninth  and 
Chestnut  Streets,  the  present  site  of  the  United  States  Post  Office,  and 
since  October  11,  1872,  in  West  Philadelphia,  on  the  magnificent  expanse 
of  ground  which  has  rendered  possible  the  addition  of  many  buildings, 
now  numbering  twenty-five,  which  give  it  a  superb  group  of  homes  for 
the  effective  maintenance  of  thirteen  branches  of  university  teaching 
and  research,  and  afford  its  students  perfect  accommodations  for  every 
phase  of  university  life  and  endeavor. 

Prior  to  1849  only  local,  non-secret,  literary  societies  existed,  and  at 
the  time  of  the  introduction  of  fraternities,  the  Philomathean  Society, 
founded  in  1813,  and  the  Zelosophic  Society,  founded  in  1831 — "Philo" 
and  "Zelo, "  as  they  are  always  called — were  keen  rivals  in  their  work 
and  in  their  claims  to  student  favor,  and  while  the  coming  of  the  Greek 
letter  men  doubtless  took  from  them  much  of  the  social  side  of  their 
activity,  the  fraternities  did  not  destroy  them,  but  only  created  and  fos- 
tered new  elements  in  the  student  body,  and  upward  of  seventy  Zetes 
have  been  active  in  their  work  and  management. 

But  one  fraternity  antedates  Zeta  Psi  at  Pennsylvania,  and  our 
Sigma  Chapter  is  the  oldest  fraternity  chapter  at  Pennsylvania  with 
continuous  existence  since  foundation. 

The  inception  of  Zeta  Psi  at  Pennsylvania  dates  from  January  1, 
1849,  when  the  twin  brothers  Edward  W.  and  Samuel  E.  Appleton 
entered  the  class  of  1852  at  the  beginning  of  its  second  term.  They  had 
intended  to  enter  Rutgers  College,  but  the  removal  of  their  parents  to 
Philadelphia  in  the  Fall  of  1848  led  to  a  change  in  their  plans.  In  the 
summer  of  1850  they  visited  New  Brunswick,  and  there  found  in  the 
membership  of  the  Delta  some  of  their  schoolboy  friends,  who  imbued 
them  with  the  spirit  of  Zeta  Psi  and  initiated  them  into  its  mysteries,  that 
they  might  return  to  Pennsylvania  as  missionaries.  Their  enthusiasm 
was  great,  and  their  earnest  efforts  met  with  quick  recognition  from 
worthy  men,  so  that  by  early  Fall  the  consent  of  the  Grand  Chapter  was 
obtained  and  the  first  initiation  set  for  September  4,  1850.  On  that  date 
John  Benjamin  Yates  Sommers,  one  of  the  founders  of  Zeta  Psi,  and  then 
$  A,  Peter  Warren  Rouss£,  of  the  Delta,  also  a  Grand  Officer,  and  the 
brothers  Appleton  conducted  the  formal  foundation  of  the  Alpha  of 
Pennsylvania  "in  a  quaint  building  still  standing  on  the  east  side 
of  Seventh  Street,  near  Sansom"  (so  described  by  Bro.  Edward 
W.  Appleton),  and  initiated  William  Lehman  Wells,  '52,  Fairman 
Rogers,  '53,  John  H.  Tingley,  '53,  and  Gideon  Scull,  Jr.,  '53.  At  that 
meeting  the  organization  of  the  chapter  was  completed  and  four  new 
members  elected;  Francis  A.  Lewis,  '52,  William  F.  Biddle,  '52,  J.  P. 
Farley  Shippen,  '53,  and  William  Moss,  '53,  who  were  duly  initiated 
three  days  later,  when  J.  Johnson  Brown,  '51,  and  Henry  Augustus 
Duhring,  '52,  were  elected  to  membership.  To  the  roll  of  the  chapter 
during  the  first  year  of  its  existence  the  following  names  were  also 
added:  Robert  E.  Randall,  '53,  John  Andrews  Harris,  '52,  William 


184  SIGMA   CHAPTER 

Blanchard,  '54,  Alfred  G.  Baker,  '51,  and  William  F.  Rogers,  '55.  Of 
the  founders,  the  brothers  Appleton  and  Fairman  Rogers  still  survive 
and  six  of  the  eleven  later  initiates  of  the  first  year. 

The  brothers  Appleton  left  Pennsylvania  in  their  Junior  year  and 
were  graduated  at  Rutgers  in  1852,  being  graduated  in  Theology  in 
1857,  and  later  receiving  the  D.  D.  degree  from  Rutgers.  They  have 
always  been  prominent  in  the  work  of  the  Protestant  Episcopal  Church. 
Rogers  has  risen  to  prominence  in  engineering  and  mechanics  and  has 
been  a  prolific  contributor  to  the  literature  of  those  branches  of  science. 
He  was  a  professor  at  Pennsylvania  from  1856  to  1871,  and  a  trustee  from 
1871  to  1885.  Baker,  Brown  and  Duhring  have  been  prominent  in  mer- 
cantile life,  Wells  and  Moss  in  medicine,  Harris  in  the  ministry, 
Randall  in  law,  Biddle  in  engineering  and  music,  and  Blanchard  as  a 
publisher.  Bro.  Shippen  died  in  April,  1853,  and  was  the  first  Zete  for 
whom  the  Sigma  men  draped  their  pins. 

At  the  time  of  the  founding  of  the  Sigma  the  total  number  of  students 
at  Pennsylvania  was  about  130,  and  in  1876  it  had  increased  to  above 
200,  with  32  instructors,  while  in  1894,  when  Dr.  William  Pepper,  '62, 
our  honored  and  lamented  first  Zete  Provost,  resigned  after  13  years  of 
preeminently  successful  service,  the  students  numbered  700,  with  96 
instructors.  Under  his  worthy  and  distinguished  classmate  and  suc- 
cessor, our  Bro.  Charles  Custis  Harrison,  '62,  over  2,600  students  are 
annually  on  the  rolls. 

From  the  earliest  days  of  the  Sigma,  the  interest  in  all  its  work  was 
intense  and  earnest.  The  "pick of  the  college"  formed  its  membership, 
and  its  minutes,  complete  from  foundation,  are  rich  in  details  of  the 
activity  of  its  members  in  the  literary  exercises,  debates  and  all  frater- 
nity work.  The  first  correspondence  was  conducted  with  the  Delta  and 
Zeta  in  relation  to  the  establishment  of  the  Chi,  and  in  August,  1851,  the 
chapter  was  first  represented  at  a  session  of  the  Grand  Chapter,  sending 
Randall  and  Scull  to  the  convention  at  New  Brunswick,  where  the 
chapter  received  its  designation  as  the  Sigma.  It  was  again  repre- 
sented at  the  convention  at  Poughkeepsie,  in  1852,  when  the  founding  of 
the  Rho  was  authorized,  and  later  was  influential  in  the  establishment 
of  the  Theta  at  Union  and  the  Tau  at  Lafayette,  the  latter  having  been 
established  by  Bros.  William  Platt  Pepper,  '57,  and  Henry  Ashurst, 
'58,  of  the  Sigma,  committee  appointed  for  that  purpose.  Delegates  were 
regularly  sent  to  all  the  conventions,  except  in  1864,  until  the  end  of  the 
civil  war,  and  in  the  last  twenty-five  years  the  Sigma  has  rarely  failed 
to  send  representatives  to  the  sessions  of  the  Grand  Chapter,  many  of 
whom  have  taken  a  prominent  part  in  its  deliberations  and  legislation. 
Four  sessions  of  the  Grand  Chapter  have  been  held  under  the  auspices  of 
the  Sigma,  in  1876,  1880,  1885  and  1892,  all  important  in  fraternity 
work,  and  pronounced  by  our  visiting  brethren  highly  successful  in  their 
social  features  and  notable  for  cordial  hospitality.  It  is  the  hope  of  the 
Sigma  that  on  March  9th  and  10th,  when  it  celebrates  its  semi-centen- 
nial in  1900  by  again  receiving  the  Grand  Chapter,  the  occasion  will 
excel  all  prior  conventions  in  Philadelphia  in  numbers,  good  work, 
enthusiasm  and  good-fellowship  in  the  bonds  of  T  K  <P.

among  them  names  which  grace  the  annals  of  industrial,  professional 
and  social  life.  The  scope  of  this  sketch  permits  of  more  detailed  refer- 
ence to  but  few  of  them. 

The  life  of  William  Pepper,  '62,  the  distinguished  physician,  teacher 
and  author,  was  devoted  to  the  progress  of  his  native  city,  and  if  fully 
told  would  almost  be  a  history  of  the  Medical  School  at  the  University 
for  twenty-five  years,  and  the  present  greatness  of  Pennsylvania  is  a 
monument  to  his  creative  genius  while  he  was  Provost.  Under  the  guid- 
ing hand  of  his  successor  as  Provost,  Charles  Custis  Harrison,  '62  (a 
trustee  since  1876),  the  University  has  progressed  with  a  mighty  strength 
in  its  work,  buildings,  endowment  and  number  of  students.  E.  Coppee 
Mitchell,  '55,  the  talented  lawyer  and  author,  was  professor  in  and  Dean 
of  the  Law  School  from  1873  until  his  death  in  1886.  Thomas  McKean, 
'62,  was  prominent  in  finance  and  as  a  benefactor  of  the  University  and 
dear  to  the  hearts  of  all  Sigma  men  for  his  warm  devotion  to  their 
interests. 

Of  the  seventy-six  Zetes  from  the  classes  of  1851  to  1865,  seventy- 
three  were  living  at  the  dawn  of  the  civil  war,  and  of  these  no  less  than 
thirty  entered  the  strife.  Of  this  number,  twenty-eight  performed 
honorable  service  and  happily  survived:  Class  of  1852,  Capt.  William  F. 
Biddle;  class  of  1853,  Robert  E.  Randall,  Sergt.  Fainnan  Rogers,  Cols. 
James  C.  Biddle  and  Gideon  Scull,  Jr.,  and  Surgeons  John  K.  Kane 
and  William  Moss;  class  of  1854,  Lieut.-Col.  Frank  M.  Etting,  Lieut. 
William  Blanchard  and  Surgeon  George  H.  Humphreys;  class  of  1855, 
Col.  George  H.  Waring;  class  of  1856,  Charles  C.  Jackson;  class  of  1857, 
George R.  Wood,  Maj.  Oswald  C.  Jackson,  Capt.  George  H.  Johnston,  Jr. , 
and  George  Gilpin;  class  of  1858,  Henry  Ashhurst;  class  of  1859,  Edwin 
X.  Benson.  Col.  William  McMichael;  class  of  1860,  Col.  Francis  Wister; 
class  of  1862,  Lieuts.  George  Pepper,  Skipwith  Wilmer  and  Reuben 
Etting;  class  of  1864,  Charles  R.  Colwell,  Washington  H.  Gilpin,  Alfred 
C.  Harrison  and  James  B.  Leonard,  and  class  of  1865,  Theodore  M. 
Etting. 

Daniel  Penrose  Buckley,  of  the  class  of  1855,  captain  of  the  Third 
New  Jersey  U.  S.  Volunteers,  died  in  the  battle  of  Gaines  Mills,  Va., 
on  July  4th,  1862,  and  Robert  Coles,  of  the  class  of  1857,  a  captain  in 
the  Confederate  army,  in  the  battle  of  Roanoke  Island,  N.  C.,  on  Febru- 
ary 8,  1862. 

From  the  classes  of  1866  to  1877,  sixty-nine  men  joined  Zeta  Psi, 
with  no  less  than  thirty-five  from  the  classes  of  '72,  '73  and  '74,  and  the 
prosperity  and  activity  of  the  chapter  were  unabated,  but  from  the 
succeeding  three  classes  only  six  men  were  taken,  while  the  class  of  1878 
shares  with  '61  the  misfortune  of  being  the  only  classes  at  Pennsylvania 
from  1851  to  1902  without  a  Zete  on  their  rolls.  Thus  ensued  the  only 
dark  days  the  Sigma  has  known,  but  they  were  only  a  passing  cloud 
dispelled  by  the  earnest  work  of  active  elders,  and  from  the  class  of  1879 
seven  enthusiastic  Zetes  were  taken  to  start  the  new  tide  of  prosperity 
which  has  never  ebbed. 

It  was  at  this  time  that  an  earnest  interest  in  athletics  began  at 
Pennsylvania,  and  of  the  sixty-three  Zetes  in  the  classes  from  1880  to 
1890,  a  majority  were  active  oa  the  track,  in  rowing,  football,  baseball 
or  cricket.  Ellis  Ames  Ballard,  '81,  won  the  half-mile  at  the  intercolle- 
giate championship  in  188O  and  the  440-yards  dash  in  1881,  and  George 
C.  Thayer,  '81,  the  running  broad  jump  in  1879  and  1880.  In  track  ath- 
letics at  the  Pennsylvania  sports  twelve  Zetes  won  no  less  than  fifty  first 
prizes  in  this  decade.  Twelve  Zetes  played  on  the  'varsity  football 
teams,  two  as  captain,  with  a  number  more  as  substitutes  and  many 
representatives  on  all  the  class  teams.  On  the  'varsity  nines  the  Sigma 
had  ten  men,  one  as  captain,  and  three  on  the  crews,  while  on  the  cricket 
eleven  twenty-two  Zetes  represented  the  'varsity,  nine  as  captains,  not 
less  than  three  Zetes  playing  in  any  year  and  in  1884  nine.  While  some 
of  the  Sigma  men  from  the  later  classes  have  also  attained  prominence 


186  SIGMA   CHAPTER 

in  athletics,  the  energies  of  most  of  them  have  been  devoted  more  to  the 
literary  and  social  activities  of  University  life.  Ten  Zetes  held  office  in 
the  Athletic  Association  prior  to  its  incorporation  in  1882,  at  which  time 
Thomas  McKean,  '62,  was  elected  its  first  president,  and  Edwin  N. 
Benson,  '59,  and  E.  Coppee  Mitchell,  '55,  vice-presidents.  Eight  Zetes 
have  since  been  directors. 

An  interesting  phase  in  the  history  of  the  Sigma  is  its  work  in  sus- 
taining the  Omicron.  The  records  show  the  initiation  of  two  men  in 
1865  and  three  in  1876,  and  a  number  under  the  authority  granted  by  the 
Grand  Chapter  in  1877  to  the  Sigma,  Delta  and  Tau.  When  this  au- 
thority was  later  restricted  to  the  Sigma  alone,  and  until  it  was  with- 
drawn, a  small  but  earnest  band  of  Zetes  was  kept  alive  at  Princeton, 
which  for  years  waged  an  active  though  unequal  contest  against  the  un- 
yielding prejudice  of  the  faculty. 

The  home  of  the  Sigma  has  been  at  but  eight  places  in  fifty  years. 
Until  1856  on  the  west  side  of  Sixth  Street  above  Spruce,  where  in  1854 
the  Chapter  experienced  its  only  depredation  by  robbers.  The  next 
move  was  to  a  location  nearer  to  the  University,  the  west  side  of  Tenth 
Street,  north  of  Market,  then  in  1858  to  1019  Walnut  Street,  and  from 
there  in  1861  to  the  south  side  of  Walnut  Street,  below  Ninth.  In  1867 
the  westward  move  was  made  to  the  southeast  corner  of  Juniper  and 
Chestnut  Streets,  and  the  same  year  records  the  Sigma's  first  banquet 
and  its  only  fire.  Then  the  home  was  moved  in  1870  to  1315  Chestnut 
Street,  whence  the  move  was  made  in  1877  to  the  northeast  corner  of 
Thirteenth  and  Chestnut  Streets,  the  last  "  rooms"  of  the  Sigma,  where 
it  remained  until  its  move  in  October,  1897,  into  its  permanent  home, 
provided  by  the  Philadelphia  Association  of  Zeta  Psi,  at  Nos.  3337  and 
3339  Walnut  Street,  its  chapter  house  within  the  shadow  of  the  Univer- 
sity. Here,  too,  the  Association,  formed  on  February  16,  1888,  and 
since  then  managing  the  successful  banquets  annually  held  by  the  Phil- 
adelphia Zetes,  incorporated  on  September  20,  1897,  furnishes  a  cozy 
retreat  for  its  members  and  visiting  brethren,  and  all  honor  is  due  by 
Zeta  Psi  to  Brother  J.  Somers  Smith,  Jr. ,  '87,  and  the  ten  earnest  Zetes 
who  were  his  colleagues  on  the  building  committee. 

Much  that  deserves  elaboration  beyond  the  space  allotted  to  this  his- 
tory, can  only  be  suggested  by  statistics.  Zetes  of  the  Sigma  have  been 
prominent  in  every  branch  of  student  life,  seventy  have  been  members 
of  the  literary  societies  and  fifteen  editors  of  the  college  journals;  they 
have  taken  forty-four  prizes  in  University  courses  and  furnished  a  dozen 
Commencement  speakers,  three  have  received  the  "spoon,"  given  to  the 
most  popular  man  in  each  class,  and  the  classes  have  been  few  at  Penn- 
sylvania which  have  not  numbered  Zetes  among  their  class  officers, 
Record  editors  and  Class  Day  speakers.  To  nine  were  assigned  promi- 
nent roles  in  the  notable  presentation  of  "  The  Acarnians  "  in  Greek  in 
1886.  Sixteen  are  members  of  the  famous  "Mask  and  Wig  Club,"  five 
of  whom  were  among  its  founders. 

The  members  of  the  Sigma  number  in  all  290  ;  of  these  65  have 
died. 

Bare  statistics  can  but  partly  indicate  the  scope  of  their  activity: 
lawyers,  52;  doctors,  26;  ministers,  10;  engineers,  20;  authors,  23;  edi- 
tors, 4,  and  professors  at  Pennsylvania,  14.  The  names  of  Sigma  Zetes 
are  found  on  the  rolls  of  the  patriotic  societies  of  America,  the  histori- 
cal, antiquarian,  scientific,  medical,  legal,  charitable  and  social  organi- 
zations of  Philadelphia,  and  the  records  of  these  societies  attest  the 
activity  of  the  Sigma  men  in  their  work. 

It  is  a  fitting  ending  to  this  brief  history  of  the  Sigma  to  record  the 
names  of  her  younger  men  who,  with  patriotic  ardor,  responded  eagerly 
to  the  call  for  volunteers  in  the  late  war  with  Spain.  In  the  "  City 
Troop,"  Sergt.  Robert  E.  Glendenning,  '88,  Corp.  George  C.  Thayer, 
'81,  and  privates  William  I.  Forbes,  '89,  Henry  S.  Godfrey,  '95,  Fran- 
cis L.  Cramp,  '96,  and  Persifor  Frazer,  Jr.,  '96. 


SIGMA  CHAPTER  187 

In  "Battery  A,"  Surgeon  George  I.  McLeod,  '91,  Lieut.  Norman 
Mac  Leod,  '93,  Corporals  Crawford  Coates,  Jr.,  '87,  and  Arthur  H. 
Brockie,  '95,  and  privates  Albert  B.  Kelley,  '92,  Carl  N.  Martin,  '96, 
J.  Mauran  Rhodes,  '96,  J.  Walter  Steel,  '99,  and  B.  Franklin  Pepper, 
'01.  A.  Wilson  Norris,  Jr.,  '91,  Lieut,  and  Adjutant  of  the  8th  Penn. 
Infantry,  and  later  Captain  and  Ass't  Adjutant-Gen.,  died  in  service 
Jan.  15,  1899.  Lloyd  C.  Griscom,  '91,  served  as  a  staff  officer  with  the 
rank  of  Captain;  Joseph  P.  Tunis,  '86,  as  Surgeon  in  the  1st  Penn., 
and  Robert  P.  Robins,  '76,  formerly  Surgeon  in  the  2d  Penn.,  is  now 
a  Brigade-Surgeon  in  the  Philippines. 

Even  from  this  brief  sketch  there  must  appear  a  worthy  fruition  of 
steadfast  and  untiring  efforts  by  earnest  men,  animated  by  a  spirit 
worthy  of  emulation  by  Zetes  of  the  Sigma  for  generations  to  come.

HISTORY  OF  THE  CHI  CHAPTER 

Colby  College  was  established  by  the  Baptist  denomination  in  1820 
in  the  town  of  Waterville,  Maine,  on  the  banks  of  the  Kennebec  River. 
Its  early  name  was  the  Maine  Literary  and  Theological  Institution. 
The  distinctly  theological  element  in  the  instruction,  however,  was 
not  long  continued,  and  the  institution  soon  became  general  in  its 
character.  The  name  became  Waterville  College.  The  number  of 
students  in  1850,  when  the  Chi  was  founded,  was  seventy-four,  practi- 
cally the  same  as  the  average  number  in  yearly  attendance  for  the 
previous  thirty  years. 

The  students  in  these  early  days,  after  the  fashion  of  the 
time,  maintained  two  local,  non-secret,  literary  societies,  the  Ero- 
sophian  Adelphi  and  the  Literary  Fraternity.  These  societies  lived 
on  for  many  years  after  the  secret  fraternities  became  popular, 
but  were  gradually  supplanted  and  given  up  entirely  in  the  middle 
seventies. 

In  the  fall  of  1849,  under  the  leadership  of  Thomas  H.  Garnsey,  of 
'53,  a  local  society  was  organized  and  named  the  Alpha  Omega.  This 
society  met  in  members'  rooms  and  occasionally  during  the  summer  of 
1850  in  appointed  places  out  in  the  fields. 

Zeta  Psi  soon  came  to  the  attention  of  the  men,  and  the  good 
position  already  attained  by  this  young  fraternity,  then  but  three 
years  old,  having  been  founded  in  the  New  York  University  in  1847, 
as  well  as  bright  prospects  for  future  growth,  led  them  to  apply  for 
a  charter. 

This  was  granted,  and  on  November  19,  1850,  J.  S.  Barry  and  E. 
J.  Peck,  of  the  Zeta  Chapter,  at  Williams  College,  being  duly  author- 
ized, initiated  the  following  men  :  Thomas  H.  Garnsey,  A.  B.  Clark, 
W.  H.  Tucker,  H.  P.  Kimball,  W.  G.  Frye,  B.  F.  Kelly,  C.  H.  Davis, 
H.  M.  Pierce,  Alfred  Owen,  S.  R.  Thurston,  R.  F.  Stratton,  J.  F. 
Baldwin,  Nathan  Butler  and  C.  W.  Lander.  The  ceremonies  occur- 
red at  No.  13  Elmwood  Hotel.  In  the  same  place  on  the  following 
day  two  more  were  added  to  the  mystic  circle — R.  J.  Knight  and  Rod- 
ney Welch.  Officers  were  immediately  elected  and  installed.  The 
Alpha  of  Maine  was  then  pronounced  "duly  and  legally  chartered, 
initiated  and  officered."  This  designation  was  used  for  about  a  year. 
On  October  25,  1851,  the  letter  Chi  was  chosen  by  the  brothers  under 
the  authority  of  the  Grand  Chapter,  and  by  this  name  has  the  Chap- 
ter since  been  known. 

Thus  Zeta  Psi  was  launched  at  Colby  with  sixteen  strong  men  as 
charter  members.  Eight  of  these  are  still  living.  Three  of  them,  A. 
Owen,  J.  F.  Baldwin  and  S.  R.  Thurston,  were  present  at  the  reunion 
in  1898,  and  delightfully  entertained  the  younger  brothers  with  reminis- 
cences of  the  old  days. 

This  favorable  beginning  was  prophetic  of  a  decade  of  steady  growth 
and  prosperity.  A  lodge-room  was  fitted  up  in  Marston  Block,  now 
known  as  Flood's  Block,  a  brick  building  on  the  west  side  of  Main 
Street,  near  the  Unitarian  Church.  This  was  occupied  till  about  the 
close  of  the  Civil  War. 

During  the  course  of  the  Chapter's  second  year,  beginning  with 
the  opening  of  the  college  in  September,  1851,  fifteen  men  were  ad- 
mitted, constituting  the  largest  number  of  initiates  that  any  single 
year  of  the  Chapter's  history  has  known.  Among  these  fifteen  was 
Nelson  Dingley,  whose  death  on  January  13,  1899,  the  entire  country 
was  called  to  mourn.  The  active  membership  has  never  been  so  large 
as  during  this  year  of  1851-'52,  when  there  were  twenty-seven  names 
on  the  roll.  The  next  largest  roll  was  that  of  1859-'60,  when  there 


232  CHI  CHAPTER 

were  twenty-six  names,  and  the  third  largest  in  1897-'98,  when  there 
were  twenty-three.  The  Chi  has  generally  been  conservative  in  the 
matter  of  numbers.  As  the  number  of  students  in  Colby  has  always 
been  small,  this  spirit  greatly  aided  the  Chi  in  securing  excellent  men. 
She  has,  however,  always  had  a  goodly  number  of  old  members  back  at 
the  beginning  of  each  college  year.  This  number  has  averaged  about 
twelve,  and  has  rfever  fallen  below  seven,  save  in  the  war  years,  1863 
and  1864,  and  in  1872.  The  average  size  of  the  Chapter  before  1866  was 
nineteen;  since  that  time  it  has  been  seventeen.  The  average  size  of 
class  delegation  has  been  six.  The  entire  enrollment  of  the  Chapter  at 
the  present  time  is  three  hundred  and  thirty-five.  Of  these  men  two 
hundred  and  fifty-nine  are  living. 

During  this  first  decade  of  the  Chapter's  history  many  of  the  best 
men  in  college  were  initiated,  and  the  Chapter  had  excellent  standing 
in  all  the  various  lines  of  college  activity.  Meetings  were  held  regu- 
larly every  two  weeks.  A  literary  programme  was  generally  rendered, 
and  special  attention  was  given  to  debate.  It  is  interesting  to  read  in 
the  record  for  July  17,  1852,  that  Nelson  Dingley  took  part  in  a  general 
discussion  of  the  question,  "Resolved,  that  this  Government  Ought  to 
Sustain  a  Protective  Tariff."  It  is  not  stated  on  which  side  he  argued, 
but  it  would  be  easy  to  imagine.  The  presiding  officer  decided  the 
question  in  the  affirmative.  During  this  period  the  Chapter  was  scrupu- 
lous in  the  minutias  of  good  order,  and  there  are  recorded  two  by-laws  as 
follows:  "Any  brother  absent  for  any  other  reasons  than  those  above 
specified  (sickness  or  absence  from  town)  shall  be  subject  to  a  fine  of 
twenty-five  cents."  "Any  brother  not  presenting  himself  within  ten 
minutes  after  the  opening  of  the  chapter  shall  be  subject  to  a  fine  of  ten 
cents,  unless  a  satisfactory  excuse  be  rendered  to  the  Chapter."  There 
were  occasional  lapses,  however,  and  at  one  time,  when  "  the  brethren" 
had  "assembled  at  a  rather  later  hour  than  usual,"  Simon  S.  Brown 
"expatiated  on  the  duty  of  being  punctual."  It  may  be  stated  here 
that  the  Chapter  has  continued  up  to  the  present  time  to  maintain  liter- 
ary exercises  of  a  high  order.  These  are  given  ordinarily  at  every  regular 
meeting.  Regular  meetings  are  now  held  once  a  week  on  Wednesday 
evenings,  the  change  from  twice  a  week  having  been  made  in  1868. 

The  history  of  the  Chi  now  approaches  the  dark  days  of  the  War  of 
the  Rebellion.  The  brothers  took  a  keen  personal  interest  in  the  coming 
crisis.  On  March  23,  1861,  Brothers  Hopkins  and  Marble  formally 
debated  the  question,  "Has  a  State  a  right  to  secede  ?"  Then  ensued 
a  very  spirited  general  discussion,  lasting  for  two  hours,  in  which  par- 
ticipated nearly  all  the  brothers.  On  April  7th,  at  the  next  regular 
meeting,  was  discussed  the  question,  "Is  the  coercion  of  a  State  prac- 
ticable ?"  This  was  followed  on  April  21st  by  the  question,  "  Is  it  the 
duty  of  students  to  volunteer  ?"  Two  days  later,  owing  to  the  prema- 
ture closing  of  the  college  term,  a  special  meeting  of  the  Chi  was  called. 
All  the  brothers  joined  in  singing  "America."  After  this  William 
A.  Hatch,  '61,  who,  with  several  other  brothers,  was  about  to  leave 
for  the  war,  feelingly  addressed  the  Chapter.  Many  others  followed 
with  remarks  that  were  filled  with  patriotism  and  loyalty,  and  the 
meeting  closed  amid  fervent  expressions  of  Godspeed  to  the  departing 
brothers. 

Now  and  again  during  the  next  four  years  the  Chapter  was  called 
upon  to  mourn  for  brothers  who  had  given  their  lives  in  sacrifice  to  coun- 
try. The  reunion  banquet  of  1865,  held  in  Masonic  Hall,  was  largely 
attended  by  elders,  and  among  these  were  many  returned  soldiers.  It 
was  a  time  of  hearty  greeting,  but  the  occasion  was  saddened  by  sincere 
sorrow  for  absent  ones  who  would  never  return.  R.  W.  Dunn,  of  '68,  as 
Marshal  of  the  Senior  Class  of  that  year,  formed  and  conducted  the  first 
Memorial  Day  procession  to  Pine  Grove  Cemetery,  in  Waterville,  to 
decorate  the  soldiers'  graves.  The  procession  was  headed  by  the  college 
students,  and  continued  by  the  citizens.  The  G.  A.  R.  had  not  then  been 


CHI  CHAPTER  233 

established  in  Waterrille,  but  a  post  was  organised  later  on  and  named 
in  honor  of  William  S.  Heath,  Chi,  '55,  who  was  killed  at  Games'  Mill 
in  1862.  In  Memorial  Hall,  on  the  Colby  campus,  is  a  beautiful  repro- 
duction in  marble  of  the  Lion  of  Lucerne.  Beneath  it  is  a  tablet  erected 
by  the  alumni  of  the  college  in  memory  of  their  fellows  who  perished 
"pro  republicas  integritate. "  Thereon  are  inscribed  twenty  names,  and 
among-  them  are  eight  which  the  Chi  especially  delights  to  honor,  the 
names  of  her  own  beloved  sons.  They  are  as  follows:  John  B.  Wilson, 
'54;  William  S.  Heath,  '55;  Sabine  Emery,  '58;  William T.  Parker,  '58; 
William  W.  West,  '60;  Asher  C.  Hinds,  '63;  George  C.  Getchell,  '63; 
Leonard  Butler,  '65. 

Out  of  a  total  membership  of  one  hundred  and  thirty-two  at  the  end 
of  the  war  the  Chi  had  furnished  to  the  cause  fifty  men.  One  of  these  was 
a  lieutenant-colonel  in  the  Confederate  Army.  Oliver  C.  Gray,  '55,  of 
Little  Rock,  Arkansas.  Of  the  forty-nine  in  the  Union  Army  there  were 
seven  privates,  one  hospital  steward,  four  surgeons,  one  brigade  surgeon, 
one  paymaster,  four  corporals,  one  provost  marshal,  one  sergeant,  four 
sergeant-majors,  one  second  lieutenant,  five  first  lieutenants,  eight  cap- 
tains, four  majors  (one  a  brevet  lieutenant-colonel),  four  lieutenant- 
colonels  (two  brevet  brigadier-generals  and  one  a  brevet  colonel),  and 
four  colonels  (one  a  brevet  brigadier-general  and  one  a  brevet  major- 
general). 

The  Chapter  was  in  sore  straits  in  1864.  In  the  fall  of  that  year 
only  two  brothers  returned  to  college.  Some  who  would  naturally  have 
returned  were  at  the  front;  Leonard  Butler,  of  '65,  had  been  killed  in 
service  at  Beaufort,  S.  C.;  A.  R.  Burrill,  of  '65,  and  R.  S.  Hinds,  of  '66, 
had  died,  the  latter  in  college;  several  had  left  to  study  professions  or 
enter  other  pursuits.  The  two  who  remained  were  Amos  B.  Lunt  and 
John  C.  Irish,  both  of  '67.  The  prospect  was  dark  and  the  condition 
discouraging.  But  these  two  worked  with  characteristic  Zeta  Psi  spirit, 
and  the  Chapter  was  saved.  They  were  magnificently  assisted  by  sev- 
eral resident  elders,  who  contributed  much  both  to  the  financial  support 
of  the  Chapter  and  to  the  interest  and  success  of  the  meetings.  To 
George  A.  Wilson,  of  '62,  in  particular  the  Chapter  owes  a  lasting  debt 
of  gratitude.  Brother  Wilson  was  often  present,  and  for  a  considerable 
period  of  1864-'65  acted  as  Phi.  Early  in  this  year  three  men  were 
initiated — R.  W.  Dunn,  F.  R.  M.  Gillpatrick  and  Austin  Thomas. 
There  was  thus  an  active  membership  of  five.  Later  in  the  year  George 
L.  Chandler,  O.  D.  Seavey  and  C.  C.  Couillard  were  added" to  the  num- 
ber. The  fall  of  1865  opened  with  seven  brothers  back;  nine  were 
initiated  during  the  year.  About  this  time  the  lodge-room  in  Marston 
Block,  occupied  by  the  Chi  since  1852,  was  abandoned,  and  new  quarters 
secured  in  Phenix  Block,  the  building  in  which  the  office  of  the  Water- 
ville  Mail  has  been  located  for  so  many  years.  These  rooms  were 
retained  till  1872.  In  the  fall  of  1866  eight  returned,  and  six  more  were 
soon  received.  The  Chapter,  now  well  on  its  feet  again,  entered  upon  a 
period  of  quiet  prosperity,  which  has  lasted  without  a  break  to  the 
present  time. 

The  early  part  of  this  period  was  marked  by  a  special  interest  in 
athletics.  The  first  regular  baseball  club  was  organized  and  a  team 
put  into  the  field.  R.  W.  Dunn,  of  '68,  was  the  first  captain  and 
pitcher;  P.  S.  Warren,  of  '69,  was  catcher;  F.  M.  Wilson  and  C.  W. 
Foster  were  prominent  players,  the  latter  said  to  be  one  of  the  best  all- 
around  men  ever  seen  on  the  Colby  diamond.  Intercollegiate  baseball 
was  instituted  at  Colby  in  1877.  Since  that  time,  with  the  exception  of 
three  years,  the  Chi  has  been  represented  on  the  nine  by  from  one  to 
three  men.  In  this  connection  the  names  of  Walter  C.  Emerson,  '84; 
Byron  Boyd,  '86;  E.  F.  Goodwin,  '87;  F.  A.  Gilmore,  '90,  and  O.  L.  Hall, 
'93,  in  particular  are  remembered  with  enthusiasm.  Football  was  first 
fully  established  at  Colby  in  1891,  and  the  Chi  took  an  active  interest 
from  the  start.  She  has  furnished  the  manager  four  times,  and  has  been 


234  CHI  CHAPTER 

represented  on  the  team  each  year  of  the  seven — in  '91,  '93  and  '98  by  one 
man;  in  '95  by  two,  and  in  '94,  '96  and  '97  by  three.  In  1895,  C.  K. 
Brooks,  '98,  was  elected  captain,  and  reelected  in  '96  and  '97.  During 
these  three  years  the  team  was  remarkably  successful,  and  in  1897  went 
through  the  season  without  a  single  defeat. 

In  scholarship  the  Chi  has  stood  well.  Out  of  the  twenty-one  first 
prizes  awarded  since  1872  for  general  excellence  in  preparation  for  col- 
lege five  have  been  won  by  Zetes.  Out  of  eleven  second  prizes  one  has 
come  to  Zeta  Psi.  In  1896  Phi  Beta  Kappa  was  established  at  Colby, 
and  in  accordance  with  the  college  records  members  of  previous  classes 
were  elected  to  membership.  The  Chi  has  one  man  from  each  of  the  fol- 
lowing years:  1850,  '53,  '56,  '57,  '59,  '61,  '62,  '63,  '64,  '74,  '76,  '77,  '81, 
'85,  '86,  '87,  '89,  '90,  '91,  '92,  '93,  '98;  two  from  each  of  the  following: 
1878,  '79,  '80,  '82,  '83,  '94,  '96.  From  the  class  of  1858  all  the  four  mem- 
bers chosen  were  Zetes — S.  S.  Brown,  C.  P.  Baldwin,  A.  L.  Hinds  and 
E.  W.  Pattison.  There  are  in  all  two  hundred  and  twenty  male  mem- 
bers, of  whom  forty  are  Zetes. 

In  composition  and  oratory  the  Chi  has  made  a  still  better  record. 
Out  of  thirty-four  prizes  awarded  to  members  of  the  Senior  Class  since 
1864  for  work  in  composition  Zetes  have  won  nine.  Out  of  thirty-seven 
first  prizes  for  Junior  orations,  fourteen,  and  out  of  the  same  number  of 
second  prizes  six  have  fallen  to  Zetes.  In  Sophomore  declamation  Zetes 
have  won  twelve  first  and  seven  second  prizes  out  of  a  possible  thirty- 
nine  in  each  case.  In  Freshman  reading  there  have  been  twenty-five 
contests,  Zetes  winning  first  place  seven  times,  and  second  seven  times. 
In  the  Freshman  exhibition  of  the  class  of  1901  the  Chi  received  the 
unusual  honor  of  having  its  entire  delegation  of  five  men  appointed  to 
participate,  although  there  were  only  nine  appointments  in  all.  F.  W. 
Newcombe  received  first  prize.  In  composition  and  oratory,  therefore,  it 
will  be  seen  that  the  Zetes  have  won  nearly  a  third  of  all  the  first  prizes 
and  a  fifth  of  the  second,  though  her  men  have  constituted  less  than  a 
sixth  of  the  men  in  college  since  1862,  when  these  prizes  began  to  be 
given.  The  average  yearly  attendance  of  men  for  the  past  thirty  years 
has  been  one  hundred  and  seventeen,  while,  as  already  stated,  the 
average  membership  of  the  Chapter  for  the  same  period  has  been 
seventeen. 

In  debate  also  the  Chi  has  secured  an  excellent  reputation.  The 
Junior  Debate  was  established  in  1889  as  an  annual  institution.  Six 
men  take  part  each  year.  The  Chi  has  been  represented  three  times  by 
one  man,  and  four  times  by  two  men.  Last  year  at  the  Intercollegiate 
Debate  between  Bates  and  Colby  two  of  the  three  men  who  made  up  the 
Colby  team  were  members  of  the  Chi — F.  F.  Lawrence,  '00,  and  H.  C. 
Libby,  '02.  This  debate  had  been  held  three  times  previously,  and  each 
time  the  Chi  had  furnished  one  speaker.  In  the  Sophomore  Debate  and 
the  College  Debate,  both  of  recent  establishment,  the  Chapter  has  taken 
part  and  received  recognition. 

In  the  matter  of  student  publications  the  Chi  has  done  her  full  share 
of  duty  and  received  her  full  share  of  honor.  An  annual  called  the 
Watervillian  was  published  each  year  from  '62  to  '66  under  the  conduct 
of  four  associate  editors.  Of  the  entire  twenty  for  these  five  years  seven 
were  Zetes.  In  1867  the  name  of  the  college  was  changed  from  Waterville 
College  to  Colby  University.  The  Watervillian  then  became  the  Colby 
Oracle.  This  has  been  issued  every  year  up  to  the  present  date.  From 
'67  to  '75  it  was  under  four  associate  editors,  of  whom  one  each  year  was 
a  Zete,  save  in  '69,  when  the  Chapter  had  no  representative  on  the  board, 
and  in  '75,  when  she  had  two.  In  '69  the  Chi  issued  alone  the  Colby 
Chronicle  and  Zeta  Psi  Annual.  G.  C.  Fisher  and  C.  W.  Chase  were  the 
editors.  This  publication  was  the  first  to  be  issued  in  Colby  by  a  single 
fraternity.  It  was  not,  however,  continued.  From  '76  to  '83  the  Oracle 
was  conducted  by  two  associate  editors,  of  whom  one  each  year  was  a 
Zete,  except  in  '81.  Since  '84  the  Oracle  has  been  under  the  manage- 


CHI  CHAPTER  235 

ment  of  a  single  editor-in-chief.  Of  the  sixteen  men  who  have  performed 
this  duty  eight  have  belonged  to  the  Chi.  Of  the  twenty-three  editors  of 
the  Colby  Echo,  published  from  '77  to  the  present  time,  first  as  a  monthly, 
later  as  a  bi-weekly,  and  now  as  a  weekly,  eight  have  been  Zetes. 

In  the  successes  of  her  sons  along  these  various  lines  the  Chi  has 
ever  rejoiced.  She  has  stood,  however,  along  with  her  sister  Chapters, 
not  primarily  for  success,  but  for  good  fellowship  and  social  helpfulness. 
To  underrate  or  despise  the  former  would  be  affectation,  but  she  can  say 
with  all  sincerity  that  she  has  sought  the  latter  first.  She  has  valued 
men  not  so  much  for  what  they  can  do,  as  for  what  they  are — in  charac- 
ter, in  congeniality,  in  cheerfulness,  in  friendliness,  in  brotherhood. 
Herein  lies  the  undefinable  Zete  spirit  which  the  Chi  feels  her  many 
years  of  history  have  enabled  her  to  understand  and  to  represent.  Evi- 
dences of  loyalty  to  this  spirit  she  cherishes  more  fondly  than  the  record 
of  her  honors.  The  annual  reunion  was  established  as  early  as  1852. 
This  has  been  well  attended.  In  1898,  for  example,  twenty-seven  elders 
were  present,  and  in  1899  twenty-two,  besides  all  the  active  brothers  and 
a  representative  of  the  Kappa  each  year.  It  has  been  a  source  of  great 
strength  and  inspiration  to  the  Chapter.  Through  all  the  reminiscences 
has  rung  the  genuine  Zeta  Psi  note,  well  expressed  in  the  recent  words 
of  a  charter  member:  "I  formed  the  best  and  most  lasting  friendships  of 
my  life  right  here,  and  my  interest  in  the  society,  and  my  care  for  its 
growth  and  honor,  do  not  decline  with  passing  years." 

"  Firm  shall  be  thy  name  forever, 

Glorious  Zeta  Psi; 
True  hearts  shall  forget  thee  never, 
Glorious  Zeta  Psi." 

A  Chapter  House  has  been  in  the  thought  of  the  brothers  for  many 
years,  and  in  1891  the  Zeta  Psi  Chapter  House  Association  was  incor- 
porated with  F.  C.  Thayer,  '65,  as  president.  In  keeping  of  this  cor- 
poration there  is  already  a  good-sized  fund,  augmented  yearly  by  gifts 
from  brothers  and  delegations,  and  it  is  hoped,  therefore,  that  before 
many  years  the  Chapter  House  will  pass  from  dream  to  reality. 

Till  then  the  Chi  will  probably  remain  in  her  present  quarters  in 
Burleigh  Block,  on  the  corner  of  Main  and  Temple  Streets.  This  block 
was  very  recently  built,  and  the  Chi  rooms  were  designed  especially  for 
the  Chapter,  and  occupy  the  whole  of  the  third  floor.  These  rooms  con- 
stitute the  Chi's  fifth  regular  home.  The  first  two  have  already  been 
mentioned.  The  third  was  in  Header  Block,  owned  by  Nathaniel 
Meader,  '63.  This  was  occupied  from  '72  to  '84.  With  a  very  fraternal 
spirit,  Brother  Meader  assisted  in  fitting  up  the  rooms,  and  during  the 
entire  period  of  occupancy  materially  helped  the  active  brothers.  The 
fourth  home — cherished  at  present,  probably,  by  more  members  of  the 
Chapter  than  any  other,  as  it  was  occupied  for  a  longer  period  than  any 
other  except  the  first — was  in  Barrelle  Block,  on  Main  Street,  opposite 
the  Common.  It  was  occupied  from  '84  to  '97.  The  present  home  is  very 
satisfactory,  and  is  by  far  the  best  the  Chi  has  ever  lived  in.  The  rooms 
are  well  furnished  and  decorated,  and  present  in  themselves  an  epitome 
of  the  Chapter's  history  and  an  evidence  of  the  loyal  spirit  of  the 
brothers.  Among  other  gifts  which  the  rooms  contain  are  an  organ 
given  by  the  elder  brothers  present  at  the  twenty-fifth  reunion,  a  sword 
and  scabbard  properly  adorned  with  Zeta  Psi  emblems,  given  by  C.  E. 
Meleney,  of  '76,  and  a  safe  given  by  A.  M.  Foss,  '85.  Upon  the  walls 
are  pictures  of  a  large  number  of  the  Chi  brothers.  All  the  recent  dele- 
gations appear  entire,  and  there  are  representatives  of  every  delegation 
from  the  very  beginning  of  the  history.  The  space  over  the  Phi's  desk 
is  occupied  by  an  elegantly  framed  crayon  group  of  the  seven  Zetes  who 
were  graduated  in  1898.  It  may  be  said  appropriately  in  connection  with 
this  account  of  the  Chapter's  lodge-rooms  that  the  brothers  have  already, 
to  some  slight  extent,  approached  the  advantages  of  a  Chapter  House  in 


236  CHI  CHAPTER 

that  the  North  division  of  South  College,  one  of  the  college  dormitories, 
has  been  largely  appropriated  to  the  use  of  Zeta  Psi  for  private  rooms. 
The  Chapter  has  also  for  many  years  maintained  a  boarding  club  at  264 
Main  Street. 

During  recent  years  the  Chi  has  taken  a  prominent  part  in  social 
affairs,  and  has  thus  been  in  full  harmony  with  the  later  administration 
of  the  college,  which  has  sought  to  make  more  of  the  social  element  in 
training  and  culture  than  has  ever  been  done  in  the  history  of  Colby. 
Particular  events  well  remembered  in  Waterville  are  a  reception  given 
in  '93,  a  reception  at  the  Elmwood  Hotel  in  '94  and  a  general  reception 
at  Soper's  Hall  in  the  fall  of  '95,  which  was  one  of  the  finest  ever  ten- 
dered by  a  fraternity  at  Colby,  and  was  a  remarkable  success.  The  '98 
delegation  in  its  Senior  year  successfully  conducted  the  Midwinter 
Promenade  and  the  Senior  Hop.  Perhaps  it  is  to  be  regarded  as  a 
social  event  in  view  of  the  fact  that  rowing  has  never  figured  prominently 
in  the  list  of  Colby  sports,  that  in  1893  Zeta  Psi  built  a  handsome  boat- 
house  on  the  banks  of  the  Messalonskee,  a  stream  justly  famed  in  local 
tradition  as  the  scene  of  many  happy  boating  and  picnic  parties. 

The  Chi  has  been  from  the  beginning  very  cordial  in  her  relations 
with  Zeta  Psi  at  large,  has  taken  a  great  interest  in  the  expansion  of 
the  fraternity,  and  has  in  turn  been  greatly  helped  by  the  interest  and 
sympathy  of  the  other  Chapters.  The  Lambda,  of  Bowdoin,  and  the  Chi 
have  been  especially  bound  together,  and  an  initiation  in  one  Chapter 
has  generally  been  attended  by  at  least  one  representative  from  the 
other.  On  these  occasions  the  familiar  Zeta  Psi  marching  song  is 
usually  rendered  with  a  verse  in  honor  of  "the  Lambda  and  the  Chi." 
In  1894  a  joint  initiation  banquet  was  held  by  the  two  Chapters  at 
Augusta.  The  warm  feeling  between  these  Chapters  is  due  not  only  to 
their  proximity,  but  to  the  fact  that  the  Chi  is  the  parent  Chapter,  the 
Lambda  having  been  founded  in  1866  by  George  L.  Chandler,  '68. 

The  Chi  is  also  the  parent  of  the  Psi  at  Dartmouth,  through  Nelson 
Dingley ;  of  the  Theta,  at  Union,  through  W.  H.  Baldwin,  and  of  the  Xi, 
at  the  University  of  Michigan,  through  Liberty  E.  Holden.  The  Psi,  at 
Dartmouth,  and  the  Epsilon,  at  Brown,  both  of  which  suspended  their 
activity  on  account  of  the  Civil  War,  were  both  reestablished  by  Chi 
men,  the  Psi  by  R.  W.  Dunn,  '68,  chairman  of  the  committee  for  reestab- 
lishment,  and  the  Epsilon  by  C.  A.  Parker,  '86.  Chi  men  also  served 
on  the  committee  for  the  establishment  of  the  Omega,  at  the  University 
of  Chicago,  and  of  the  Pi,  at  the  Rensselaer  Polytechnic  Institute.  The 
Grand  Chapter  of  1858  was  held  in  Waterville  under  the  auspices  of  the 
Chi,  and  the  Chi  has  been  represented  at  nearly  every  Grand  Chapter 
by  from  one  to  three  regular  delegates  besides  uncredentialed  brothers. 
Chi  men  have  presided  at  five  Grand  Chapters — George  Bradley,  '53,  as 
acting  Phi  Alpha  in  1854,  and  as  Phi  Alpha  in  1855;  R.  W.  Dunn,  '68, 
as  acting  Phi  Alpha  in  1871,  and  as  Phi  Alpha  in  1872,  and  Liberty  E. 
Holden  as  Phi  Alpha  in  1884.  The  following  Chi  men  have  held  subor- 
dinate rank  in  various  Grand  Chapters:  Nelson  Dingley,  '55,  Alpha  Phi 
Alpha;  Charles  A.  Miller,  '56,  Alpha  Sigma  Alpha;  C.  E.  Meleney,  '76, 
Alpha  Sigma  Alpha;  C.  W.  Sanger,  '56,  Gamma  Alpha;  George  L. 
Chandler,  '68,  Gamma  Alpha,  and  J.  Manchester  Haynes,  '60,  Sigma 
Rho  Alpha. 

The  Chi  will  celebrate  her  semicentennial  on  June  26th,  1900.  Her 
record  has  entitled  her  to  a  large  share  in  the  councils  of  the  college, 
and  accordingly  the  principal  public  exercise  of  the  Seventy-ninth 
Annual  Commencement  has  been  placed  in  her  charge,  and  will  be 
given  under  her  directions.  She  will  furnish  the  presiding  officer,  the 
orator  and  the  chaplain,  and  it  is  confidently  expected  that  the  occasion 
will  constitute  a  fitting  climax  to  fifty  years  of  unbroken  and  honorable

HISTORY  OF  THE  EPSILON  CHAPTER 

The  history  of  the  Epsilon  of  Zeta  Psi  falls  naturally  into  three 
chapters.  The  first  of  these  covers  the  period  from  its  establishment,  in 
1852,  to  its  discontinuance,  in  1861,  by  the  enlistment  of  practically  all  its 
members  for  the  defense  of  the  Union.  After  an  interval  of  three  years 
the  organization  was  renewed  in  1864  and  continued  until  the  latter  part 
of  1876.  Ten  years  elapsed  before  the  chapter  was  again  revived  in  1886. 
In  all  232  men  have  been  initiated,  110  of  whom  have  joined  the  chapter 
since  1886. 

In  the  spring  of  1852,  when  Zeta  Psi  was  introduced  at  Brown,  the 
University  was  flourishing  under  the  able  management  of  Dr.  Francis 
Wayland.  The  material  resources  and  equipment,  though  meagre  meas- 
ured by  modern  standards,  were  considerable  for  those  days,  while 
the  earnestness  of  purpose  and  intellectual  alertness  of  the  students 
would  challenge  comparison  with  anything  that  we,  now  at  the  end  of 
the  century,  can  show  in  the  way  of  academic  or  scientific  interest.  The 
atmosphere  of  the  college  made  its  way  into  all  student  organizations. 
Literary  societies  flourished.  Hence  that  intellectual  companionship 
which  the  elders  of  the  "Fifties"  so  fondly  remember  and  praise  as  an 
essential  feature  of  fraternity  life.  The  more  social  ends  that  fraterni- 
ties now  keep  in  view  were  at  that  date  hardly  regarded  as  sufficient  in 
themselves  or  as  having  force  enough  to  hold  together  a  band  of  students. 
Whatever  we  may  feel  to  be  the  merits  of  either  view,  the  fact  remains 
that  the  early  founders,  by  making  ability  more  than  geniality  or  ac- 
complishment the  basis  of  their  choice,  built  on  sterling  qualities  and 
built  to  last.  There  were  few  distractions,  either  social  or  athletic. 
Everywhere  was  an  air  of  seriousness  and  of  work. 

In  such  an  atmosphere  and  in  a  college  with  a  Faculty  of  twelve  and 
a  student  body  of  two  hundred  and  twenty-five  the  Epsilon  Chapter  of 
Zeta  Psi  was  founded  on  April  21,  1852.  Five  fraternities  were  already 
in  the  field,  only  three,  however,  having  been  represented  at  Brown  for 
more  than  five  years.  There  was  an  abundance  of  good  material  for  the 
new  chapter  and  the  wisdom  of  establishing  it  was  shown  at  once  by 
the  energy  which  the  Epsilon  displayed  and  the  influence  which  it  im- 
mediately exerted.  John  A.  Gardiner,  '52,  son  of  a  prominent  Providence 
physician,  was  the  prime  mover  of  the  organization.  With  him  were  asso- 
ciated as  charter  members  Charles  E.  Staples,  Miles  Fletcher,  Asa  Arnold, 
William  D.  Chaffee,  Stoughton  A.  Fletcher  and  Addison  W.  Preston.  The 
actual  ceremony  of  initiation  and  inauguration  was  performed  by  Brothers 
from  the  Delta.  On  the  30th  of  April  Bro.  Rousse  of  that  chapter  brought 
the  Epsilon  the  charter  and  various  paraphernalia  still  in  its  possession. 
By  June  of  this  same  year  the  membership  had  been  increased  to  thirteen. 

From  the  first  the  chapter  had  a  vigorous  internal  life,  and  at  the 
same  time  made  itself  felt  in  all  college  activities.  Furthermore,  it  en- 
tered at  once,  and  in  a  surprising  way,  into  the  life  of  the  fraternity  at 
large.  This,  as  it  is  always  bound  to  do,  had  a  very  quickening,  reac- 
tive effect  upon  the  chapter.  Cordial  and  intimate  relations  were  imme- 
diately established  with  the  Rho,  at  Harvard,  and  the  Kappa,  at  Tufts. 
In  1858  Bro.  Charles  D.  King  was  the  chief  agent  in  establishing  a 
chapter  at  Amherst.  This  energy  and  enthusiasm  aroused  the  corporate 
spirit  of  new  and  old  chapters  alike,  and  drew  from  the  neighbors  of  the 
Epsilon  many  warm  commendations  of  her  spirit.  At  Commencement, 
1859,  the  Grand  Chapter  was  entertained  in  Providence,  and  was  pre- 
sided over  by  a  $  A  from  the  Epsilon  Chapter. 

Naturally,  a  secret  organization  has  little  external  history  except 
the  personal  record  of  its  members.  For  such  accounts  the  reader  is  re- 
ferred for  the  most  part  to  the  biographical  sketches.  However,  a  few 


288  EPSILON  CHAPTER 

deserve  especial  mention — men  whose  after  lives  are  an  indication  of  their 
own  ability  and  of  the  personnel  of  the  chapter  in  its  ante  bellum  days. 
Of  the  charter  members,  the  Hon.  John  A.  Gardiner  was  long-  a 
prominent  member  of  the  Rhode  Island  Legislature  and  of  the  Rhode 
Island  bar.  From  1871  till  his  death  in  1879  he  was  U.  S.  district  at- 
torney. Throughout  his  busy  life  his  interest  in  the  chapter  of  his 
foundation  and  his  enthusiasm  for  Zeta  Psi  were  sustained.  The  Hon. 
David  H.  Goodell,  of  the  class  of  '56,  served  the  Commonwealth  of  New 
Hampshire  long  and  well,  and  was  finally,  in  1889-91,  honored  by  his 
fellow-citizens  with  the  highest  post  at  their  disposal,  the  Governorship. 
His  contemporary,  the  Hon.  Elisha  Dyer,  of  the  class  of  '59,  has  received 
a  like  honor.  Since  1897  he  has  held  the  Gubernatorial  chair  of  the  State 
of  Rhode  Island,  a  chair  occupied  by  his  father  before  him.  Edward  H. 
Cutler,  of  the  class  of  '57,  enjoys  a  brilliant  reputation  as  an  educator 
and  a  scholar,  fulfilling  the  promise  he  gave  in  college.  The  names  of  the 
Grosvenors  stand  for  competence  and  success  in  the  field  of  business  enter- 
prise. Of  the  many  who  served  the  city  of  Providence,  developing  her 
industries  and  directing  her  councils,  there  is  not  room  to  speak.  We 
shall  proceed  to  devote  the  remainder  of  our  space  to  the  war  record  of 
the  Epsilon. 

At  the  outbreak  of  the  Civil  War  the  able-bodied  men  of  the  chapter 
without  exception  entered  the  service  of  the  country.  One  only  was  left 
to  maintain  the  name  of  Zeta  Psi  in  Brown,  and  on  his  graduation  in 
1863  the  chapter  lapsed  for  a  while.  Eighteen  Zeta  brethren  in  all  fought 
for  the  old  flag.  Three  laid  down  their  lives — Miles  Fletcher,  '52,  Capt. 
Charles  A.  Kneass,  '58,  and  Capt.  J.  C.  Williams,  '61.  Three  attained 
to  the  rank  of  colonel,  while  three  others — W.  G.  Ely,  '54,  Livingston 
Satterlee,  '60,  and  Wm.  Ames,  '63 — were  brevetted  brigadier-generals. 
All  but  three  received  commissions  of  one  sort  or  another.  The  chapter 
died,  but  it  might  be  said  "dulce  et  decorum  est  pro  patria  mori." 

At  the  close  of  the  war,  the  Elders  of  the  Epsilon,  proud  of  their  past 
and  feeling  honored  in  their  very  extinction,  decided  to  put  the  chapter 
on  a  peace  footing  once  more.  On  April  21,  1864,  the  twelfth  anniversary 
of  the  founding  of  the  chapter,  it  was  reestablished — to  endure,  as  it 
proved,  for  twelve  years.  In  those  twelve  years  53  men  were  added  to  the 
fraternity.  The  growth  in  numbers  during  this  period  was  much  slower 
than  for  the  years  1852-60  or  1886-99.  In  the  earlier  years  it  averaged 
seven  per  annum,  in  the  middle-age  four,  and  in  the  last  period  eight. 

On  turning  over  the  biographical  list  we  find  a  long  line  of  success- 
ful men  of  affairs,  to  choose  from  whom  would  be  almost  invidious.  Bro. 
Atwater,  '65,  and  Bro.  J.  C.  B.  Woods,  '72,  have  both  been  honored  by 
election  to  the  corporation  of  Brown  University.  Bro.  George  Hitchcock, 
also  of  the  class  of  '72,  has  won  for  himself  a  place  in  the  front  rank  of 
American  artists  and  an  international  reputation.  His  work  has  received 
the  gold  medal  at  more  than  one  international  exposition,  and  his  pic- 
tures hang  in  the  Royal  Collections  at  Dresden  and  Vienna.  Sayles 
Memorial  Hall  is  a  monument  to  Bro.  Wm.  C.  Sayles,  '78,  who  died  be- 
fore completing  his  college  course. 

In  December,  1871,  the  Grand  Chapter  was  for  a  second  time  enter- 
tained by  the  Epsilon.  The  prosperity  of  the  chapter  received  in  the 
years  immediately  ensuing  a  sudden  check,  so  that  in  1876  the  number 
of  active  members  having  sunk  to  three,  the  chapter  again  went  out  of  exist- 
ence. Ten  years  elapsed  before  its  revival  in  1886,  since  which  time  it  has 
had  a  career  without  vicissitudes.  The  work  of  reestablishment  was 
effected  by  Bro.  Charles  A.  Parker,  '86,  an  initiate  of  the  Chi  Chapter 
at  Colby,  who  came  to  Brown  and  took  his  degree  in  1886.  By  his  untir- 
ing efforts  fifteen  excellent  men  from  the  four  classes  were  banded 
together  for  upwards  of  a  year,  receiving  their  initiation  into  the  fra- 
ternity on  April  17,  1886. 

The  chapter  owes  much  of  its  present  prosperity  to  the  excellent 
judgment  of  Bro.  Parker,  who  selected  his  men  deliberately  and  care- 


EPSILON  CHAPTER  289 

fully.  The  field  was  well  taken  by  the  older  fraternities;  the  long 
interval  since  1876  had  broken  traditions  and  misjudgment  meant 
failure.  Much,  too,  is  due  to  the  persistent  loyalty  and  generosity  of 
the  Elders.  Two  destructive  fires  in  quick  succession  destroyed  the 
chapter's  property,  but  the  loss  of  chattels  did  not  discourage  nor  thwart 
those  who  were  bound  to  rehabilitate  Zeta  Psi.  Every  Epsilon  man 
owes  an  almost  personal  obligation  to  Bro.  Edwin  G.  Dexter,  '91,  who, 
at  great  risk,  rescued  the  archives  and  charter  of  the  chapter  from  the 
flames. 

The  events  in  the  life  of  the  Epsilon  since  1886  have  hardly  crystal- 
lized into  history.  Its  policy  has  been  progressive  and  its  tradition  of 
quick  and  sympathetic  touch  with  the  other  chapters  has  been  zealously 
maintained.  January  15  and  16,  1891,  were  made  memorable  by  a  third 
visit  of  the  Grand  Chapter  of  Zeta  Psi  to  Providence.  The  Convention  was 
one  of  the  largest  in  the  history  of  the  fraternity  and  naturally  had  the 
effect  of  quickening  the  life  of  the  chapter. 

Not  much  can  be  said  of  the  achievements  of  the  Elders  of  the  re- 
vived chapter.  Hardly  time  enough  has  elapsed.  Still  in  1898,  on  the 
issue  of  the  call  to  arms,  the  Epsilon  remembered  her  traditions.  Two 
officersof  the  1st  R.  I.  Vols.  were  young  Elders — Capt.  Maurice  H.  Cook, 
'97,  and  Lieut.  Herbert  D.  Casey,  '94.  In  the  Navy  Alexander  D.  Sharp, 
Jr.,  '75,  of  Annapolis  Naval  Academy,  Lieut. -Commander  of  U.  S.  S. 
"Vixen,"  was  advanced  by  the  President  five  numbers  on  the  list  for 
"eminent  and  conspicuous  conduct  in  battle." 

In  closing,  a  brief  statement  of  some  of  the  achievements  of  BrownZetes 
in  college  matters  may  help  to  an  appreciation  of  the  Epsilon  Chapter. 
From  the  days  when  Jastram,  '60,  rowed  on  the  crew  down  to  the  present 
time  the  chapter  has  shown  prowess  on  the  track,  the  diamond  and  the 
gridiron,  as  the  names  of  Marvel,  "Woodcock  and  Robinson  will  attest  to 
Brown  Alumni  at  least.  The  dramatic  interests  of  the  college  were 
organized  in  the  "Hammer  and  Tongs  Society"  by  Bro.  Francis  Lawton, 
'69,  past  $  A;  and  author  of  the  words  of  "The  Badge  of  Zeta  Psi"; 
they  were  revived  and  again  organized  largely  through  the  efforts  of 
Colvin,  '91,  and  Keating,  '95,  in  the  year  1895  by  the  production  of 
"Priscilla;  or,  The  Maid  of  Brown."  Owen,  '90,  was  one  of  the 
founders  of  the  Brown  Magazine,  the  College  Literary,  and  Epsilon  men 
were  the  projectors  and  printers  of  the  Brown  Daily  Herald. 

The  chapter  has,  true  to  the  spirit  of  the  fraternity,  striven  to  bring 
together  congenial  men.  It  has  never  sacrificed  harmony  of  spirit  to 
gather  in  men  of  distinction  or  men  distinguished  in  one  line  only.  It 
has  striven  for  the  most  vigorous  local  life,  combined  with  the  largest 
fraternal  life,  to  mould  Brown  Zetes.  Conscious  of  the  dignity  of  its  past 
and  of  its  present  strength,  the  Epsilon  looks  forward  confidently  to  a 
career  of  credit  and  usefulness  in  realizing  the  spirit  and  widening  and 
consolidating  ever  firmer  the  bonds  of  T  K  3>.

HISTORY  OF  THE  RHO  CHAPTER 

Harvard  College,  the  earliest  institution  of  learning  in  the  United 
States  and  also  on  the  continent  of  North  America,  had  its  inception  in  a 
grant  of  £  400  made  in  1636  by  the  General  Council  of  the  Massachusetts 
Bay  Colony,  which  in  1630  had  settled  on  the  present  site  of  the  city  of 
Boston.  This  endowment  soon  led  to  private  gifts,  and  the  school  was 
thus,  from  its  very  beginning',  largely  supported  by  private  munificence 
rather  than  by  appropriations  from  the  public  treasury.  These  gifts  for 
supplies,  endowments  and  buildings  have  increased  with  the  increase 
in  population  and  wealth  of  the  colonies,  and  later  of  the  United  States, 
until  Harvard,  the  largest  University  on  this  side  of  the  Atlantic  and 
one  of  the  strongest  institutions  of  learning  in  the  world,  stands  to-day  a 
striking  example  of  the  well-directed  generosity  of  individuals. 

Among  the  first  gifts,  a  large  and  generous  one  considering  the  gen- 
eral poverty  of  the  colonists,  was  that  of  Rev.  John  Harvard,  B.  A.,  1632, 
and  M.  A.,  1635,  of  Emmanuel  College,  Cambridge,  England,  who, 
dying  in  Charlestown,  Mass. ,  in  1638,  by  will  left  half  his  estate,  about 
;£800,  and  his  library  to  the  school.  In  commemoration  of  this  gift  the 
name  of  the  site  was  changed  from  "Newtowne"  to  Cambridge,  and  the 
school  was  called  Harvard  College.  The  college  charter  of  1650  declared 
the  object  to  be  "the  education  of  the  English  and  Indian  youth  of  this 
country  in  knowledge  and  godlyness, "  and  the  first  brick  edifice,  with 
rooms  for  twenty  of  the  aborigines,  was  called  "the  Indian  college." 
In  this  building  was  printed  Eliot's  translation  of  the  Bible  into  the  lan- 
guage of  the  natives,  with  primers,  grammars,  tracts,  etc.  Several  of 
the  natives  were  members  of  the  college.  Only  one  was  graduated  from 
it,  although  generous  aid  for  this  special  object  was  received  from  abroad. 

Harvard  College,  from  its  foundation  in  1636  until  the  establishment 
of  professorships  in  medicine  in  1782,  comprised  the  whole  of  the  institu- 
tion now  known  as  Harvard  University.  From  it  have  sprung  the  Scien- 
tific School,  opened  in  1848  as  the  Lawrence  Scientific  School,  in 
commemoration  of  a  gift  of  the  Hon.  Abbott  Lawrence,  and  the  Graduate 
School,  which  formally  came  into  existence  in  1872,  although  graduate 
instruction  had  been  given  many  years  previous  to  that  date.  Among  the 
schools  which  form  the  present  Harvard  University  the  Law  and  Medical 
Schools  have  long  held  a  prominent  place  among  the  professional  schools 
in  America.  Throughout  its  history  Harvard  has  stood  for  progress,  and 
its  influence  on  the  educational  ideas  of  to-day  cannot  be  overestimated. 
Here  the  so-called  elective  system  was  introduced  with  the  advent  of  Presi- 
dent Eliot,  and  instruction  in  science  was  early  established  and  raised 
to  the  dignity  of  the  courses  of  the  old  college  curriculum.  In  1899-1900 
the  number  of  instructors  in  the  various  faculties  was  442,  the  number  of 
students  4,067,  the  library  contained  525,000  volumes  and  the  funds 
amounted  to  nearly  $12,000,000. 

The  society  system  is  one  peculiar  to  Harvard  as  a  man  may  belong 
to  several  societies  during  his  college  career.  The  oldest  of  these  socie- 
ties are  the  Institute  of  1770,  Phi  Beta  Kappa,  founded  in  1781,  Porcellian 
in  1791,  and  the  Hasty  Pudding  in  1795.  The  Institute  is  a  sophomore 
society  consisting  of  from  fifty  to  one  hundred  members,  including  what 
is  known  as  the  Dickie,  whose  object  is  simply  good  fellowship.  Phi 
Beta  Kappa  is  based  here  as  elsewhere  upon  scholarship.  The  Porcel- 
lian is  an  exclusive  club,  consisting  chiefly  of  wealthy  students.  It  has 
occupied  the  same  quarters  for  over  half  a  century  and  has  a  library  of 
7,000  volumes.  Its  membership  includes  many  illustrious  names,  such 
as  Charming,  Story,  Edward  Everett,  Prescott,  Oliver  Wendell  Holmes, 
Motley,  Lowell  and  Sumner.  The  Hasty  Pudding  Club,  so  called  from 


326  RHO  CHAPTER 

its  custom  of  eating-  hasty  pudding  at  the  meeting's  instead  of  the  ordinary 
bread  and  milk  which  formed  the  supper  of  the  college  students  in  early 
days  of  the  societies,  was  organized  to  promote  good  fellowship,  to  afford 
rational  enjoyment  and  to  strengthen  the  ties  of  friendship.  The  A.  D. 
Club  is  an  upper-class  club  in  the  strictest  sense  of  the  term  and  offers 
to  an  exclusive  set  of  men,  principally  from  Boston,  the  advantages  of  a 
regular  city  club. 

In  addition  to  these  local  class  societies,  attempts  have  been  made,  with 
vary  ing  degrees  of  success,  to  introduce  the  Greek-letter  societies.  Although 
these  attempts  were  made  quite  early  in  the  history  of  Greek-letter  fra- 
ternities, not  one  has  been  successful  in  maintaining  a  fraternity  chapter 
based  upon  the  general  fraternity  idea,  including  men  initiated  from  all 
classes  and  close  affiliation  with  chapters  at  other  colleges,  without  in- 
termissions. A  chapter  of  one  fraternity  was  founded  as  a  literary  circle ; 
the  number  of  men  initiated  soon  increased  very  rapidly;  the  connection 
with  the  rest  of  the  fraternity  became  slight;  the  chapter  was  suspended. 
A  chapter  of  a  second  fraternity  was  early  established,  was  maintained 
with  success  for  a  short  time,  then  became  a  sophomore  society  with  a 
membership  of  forty  or  more  from  each  class,  many  of  whom  joined  other 
fraternities  in  junior  or  senior  years;  honorary  members  were  initiated; 
practically  all  connection  with  the  rest  of  the  fraternity  was  broken  off; 
the  chapter  was  carried  by  the  fraternity,  until  recently,  in  spite  of  its 
loose  methods  and  irregularities.  A  third  fraternity  organized  a  chap- 
ter in  the  early  fifties  as  an  upper-class  society  but  the  chapter  did  not 
survive  the  strife  between  the  local  clubs  and  the  fraternity  chapters, 
which  culminated  in  '57  in  resolutions  by  many  students  not  to  join  any 
fraternity.  A  subsequent  attempt  to  reestablish  was  successful  for  but 
a  short  time  only. 

The  history  of  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity  at  Harvard  naturally  falls 
into  three  periods,  I,  1852-7;  II,  1864-7;  and  III,  1882-92. 

I.  The  eighth  chapter  of  Zeta  Psi,  the  Rho  at  Harvard,  owes  its  exis- 
tence to  the  zeal  of  Peter  W.  Rousse,  Delta  '50,  who  was  also  active 
in  establishing  chapters  at  Rutgers,  Princeton,  Pennsylvania  and 
Brown.  Acting  under  authority  of  the  Grand  Chapter,  Rousse,  then 
attending  the  Harvard  Law  School,  with  the  assistance  of  E.  W.  Apple- 
ton,  Delta  '52,  on  July  12,  1852,  initiated  seven  men,  George  Ludovic 
Bennet,  David  Hill  Coolidge,  George  Converse  Francis,  Francis  Brown 
Kendall,  Gorham  Park  and  Charles  Edward  Stetson,  all  sophomores 
of  the  class  of  '54.  Eight  men  were  added  to  this  nucleus  in  the  fall, 
and  the  new  chapter  was  started  well  organized,  with  vigorous  life  and 
zeal  for  Zeta  Psi.  During  the  years  1852-6  from  twelve  to  fifteen  men 
were  initiated  each  year  with  great  regularity  from  the  sophomore 
and  junior  classes.  The  members  continued  active  throughout  their 
college  course,  and  almost  all  of  them  were  regularly  graduated.  The 
membership  included  some  of  the  best  men  in  college.  Many  have  since 
become  prominent  and  have  contributed  to  reflect  credit  upon  the 
Fraternity. 

In  Grand  Chapter  the  Rho  was  first  represented  at  the  meeting  at 
Poughkeepsie,  July  21-23,  1853,  by  G.  L.  Bennet,  who  was  active  in  the 
fraternity  councils  for  many  years.  The  chapter  was  represented  in 
most  of  the  Grand  Chapter  meetings  during  its  life  and  took  an  active 
part  in  the  deliberations.  The  old  constitution  was  referred  to  the  Rho 
Chapter  for  a  report  on  revision,  and  the  establishing  of  the  Kappa 
Chapter  at  Tufts  College  was  the  work  of  the  men  of  the  Rho.  Until 
1857  the  chapter  life  was  uninterrupted  by  any  serious  internal  or  ex- 
ternal troubles.  By  this  time  several  of  the  Greek-letter  fraternities 
were  well  established  and  an  active  and  open  conflict  between  the  old- 
established  local  clubs  and  these  fraternity  chapters  was  commenced. 
In  this  conflict  members  of  the  faculty,  adhering  to  the  old  traditions, 
took  sides  with  the  local  clubs.  The  controversy  culminated  in  a  reso- 
lution of  many  of  the  students  not  to  join  the  fraternities;  several  of  the 


RHO  CHAPTER  327 

Rho  Chapter  men  resigned;  the  opposition  seemed  too  great  to  be  over- 
come, and  the  chapter  ceased  to  exist  in  1857. 

II.  The  reestablishment  of  the  Rho,  in  1864,  following  a  period  of  in- 
activity of  seven  years,  was  principally  due  to  the  work  of  Nathan  Payne 
Cochran,  Xi  '64.  Filled  with  enthusiasm  for  Zeta  Psi,  and  with  a  de- 
sire to  continue  the  associations  of  good  fellowship  of  his  University  of 
Michigan  life,  he,  upon  entering  the  Harvard  Law  School  in  the  fall  of 
1864,  conceived  the  plan  of  reviving  the  chapter.  The  Zetes  whom  he 
consulted  entered  heartily  into  this  plan,  and  with  the  assistance  of 
delegates  from  the  Kappa  Chapter  at  Tufts  College,  twelve  of  the  very  best 
men  in  college  were  initiated  May  29,  1865.  Charles  Warren  Clifford, 
'65,  and  John  Henry  Coppenhagen,  '66,  were  especially  active  in  gather- 
ing together  this  nucleus.  One  of  the  members  of  the  Rho  of  this  period 
writes:  "they  were  fine  students,  elegant  gentlemen,  congenial  good 
fellows."  The  first  initiations  were  held  in  apartments  at  the  Revere 
House,  Boston.  Subsequent  initiations  were  held  at  various  places  until 
a  hall  was  secured,  which  was  elaborately  fitted  up. 

The  chapter  led  a  short  but  brilliant  career  of  three  years.  In  1865 
and  '66  there  were  initiated  of  the  present  members  of  the  Fraternity, 
seven  from  the  class  of  '65,  eleven  from  '66,  twenty-five  from  '67,  thirteen 
from  '68,  twenty  from  '69  and  seven  from  '70.  At  the  Grand  Chapter 
meetings  of  '65  and  '66,  the  Rho  was  represented  by  delegates.  The 
relations,  however,  between  the  Grand  Chapter  and  the  Rho  of  this 
period  were  never  intimate  nor  cordial.  The  membership  was  larger 
than  the  spirit  of  the  Fraternity  could  tolerate  and  the  regulations  of 
constitution  and  by-laws  were  not  rigidly  enforced.  A  committee 
appointed  at  the  Grand  Chapter  meeting,  New  York,  December  26,  to 
investigate  the  condition  of  the  Rho,  having  reported  at  the  next  meet- 
ing, New  York,  December  27,  1867,  through  its  chairman,  Thomas 
Appleton,  in  favor  of  withdrawing  the  charter,  the  report  was  adopted 
and  a  committee  was  appointed  to  close  up  the  affairs  of  the  chapter. 
In  turning  over  to  the  committee  the  charter  and  chapter  records  the 
following  action  was  submitted,  signed  by  the  officers  representing  the 
Rho  Chapter:  "Having  been  deprived  by  the  disloyalty  of  some  former 
brothers  of  the  power,  acquired  after  a  three  years'  struggle,  to  protect 
our  brothers  of  the  underclasses  in  the  principal  open,  local  societies, 
and  weak  from  frequent  resignations,  it  was  believed  that  the  best 
interests  of  the  fraternity  would  be  served  by  discontinuing  the  late  or- 
ganization of  the  Rho  Chapter." 

III.  The  question  of  reestablishing  the  chapter  at  Harvard  came 
up  for  discussion  at  almost  every  Grand  Chapter  meeting  from  1874  to 
1882.  Several  unfavorable  reports  were  submitted,  emphasis  being  laid 
upon  the  attitude  of  the  old-established  local  clubs,  the  tendency  of  Har- 
vard men  to  hold  themselves  aloof  from  other  colleges,  and  the  attitude  of 
opposition  on  the  part  of  students  and  faculty  to  Greek-letter  societies  as 
shown  in  the  past.  In  1881  the  discussion  became  more  favorable  towards 
reestablishment;  the  Alpha  Chapter  at  Columbia  was  authorized  to  re- 
ceive a  petition  for  a  new  chapter  at  Harvard;  at  the  following  meeting 
of  the  Grand  Chapter,  held  at  Syracuse,  January  4,  1882,  after  discus- 
sion, the  matter  was  left  to  the  Grand  Officers  with  power. 

Henry  Hamilton  Sherwood  had  entered  Harvard  College  in  1881, 
from  the  University  of  California,  where  he  had  been  initiated  into  Zeta 
Psi  through  the  Iota  Chapter.  He  brought  with  him,  as  a  result  of  one 
year's  association  with  the  Fraternity,  zeal  for  Zeta  Psi  and  the  de- 
sire for  fraternal  fellowship.  Through  his  efforts  a  nucleus  was  gath- 
ered together,  a  petition  was  sent  to  the  Grand  Officers,  which  was  ap- 
proved, and  the  chapter  was  again  formally  brought  into  existence 
February  17, 1882.  The  exercises  were  conducted  with  appropriate  cere- 
monies at  Young's  Hotel,  Boston,  in  the  presence  of  a  number  of  visiting 
members  of  the  Fraternity,  by  Augustus  Van  Wyck,  Upsilon,  '61,  Phi 
Alpha;  Max  Schwerin,  Jr.,  Theta,  '66,  former  Alpha  Phi  Alpha;  Walter 


328  RHO  CHAPTER 

Graeme  Eliot,  Alpha,  '80;  Franklin Platte  Sherwood,  Alpha,  '81;  Richard 
McDonald  Spencer,  Alpha,  '81;  William  Henckle  Smith,  Sigma,  '80; 
John  Barton  Townsend,  Jr.,  Sigma,  '81,  and  Henry  Hamilton  Sher- 
wood, Iota,  '77;  the  old  Rho  was  represented  by  Gen.  Samuel  B.  Law- 
rence and  Col.  Henry  Walker. 

The  following  men  were  initiated:  Henry  Gardner  Chapin,  John  Sid- 
ney Webb,  Oliver  Allen  Olmstead,  James  Woods  Babcock,  Morton  Stimson 
Crehore,  of  the  class  of  '52;  Charles  Page  Perin,  John  Dickinson  Sher- 
wood, of  '53;  Frederick  Randolph  King,  '54;  these  eight  men,  together 
with  Henry  Hamilton  Sherwood,  '52,  forming  the  charter  members.  Ad- 
ditions were  made  before  Commencement  and  in  the  fall,  so  that  by 
January,  1883,  the  chapter  was  well  organized  with  twenty  members. 

The  new  chapter  was  thus  started  in  excellent  condition;  assurance 
was  given  that  members  of  all  classes  from  freshman  up  would  be 
eligible,  and  that  the  membership  would  be  kept  within  constitutional 
limits;  the  duties  of  the  various  offices  were  faithfully  performed  and 
the  members  worked  in  hearty  cooperation  to  advance  the  interests 
of  chapter  and  of  Fraternity.  The  new  organization  at  once,  through  the 
careful  selection  of  its  members,  commanded  the  respect  of  the  college 
community.  The  very  best  men  in  college  were  selected  with  little  or  no 
competition,  and  with  the  result  that  there  were  added  to  the  rolls  of  Zeta 
Psi  men  who  have  attained  prominence  in  the  various  callings  of  active 
life,  social,  professional  and  business. 

The  chapter  soon  acquired  the  reputation  of  being  perhaps  the  most 
exclusive  set  of  men  in  Harvard  social  circles.  Quoting  from  a  letter  to 
the  Zeta  Psi  Quarterly,  of  date  October,  1884:  "Our  membership  is  full 
and  such  is  the  established  reputation  of  the  chapter  that  about  twice — 
or  more — as  many  men  would  like  to  get  in  as  can  be  taken  in  under  the 
constitution.  We  have  the  captains  of  all  the  class  crews,  the  first  mar- 
shal of  the  senior  class,  the  captains  of  the  'varsity  football  team  and 
baseball  nine,  and  other  prominent  men  in  social  and  athletic  circles." 
Clubrooms  were  maintained  with  all  the  appointments  of  a  city  club. 
Soon  after  its  reestablishment,  however,  the  tendency  of  the  Rho  to 
assume  the  characteristics  of  the  local  clubs  became  noticeable.  Various 
attempts  to  offset  this  tendency  not  meeting  with  success,  in  December, 
1892,  the  charter  was  withdrawn  and  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity  ceased  to 
be  represented  at  Harvard  University.

HISTORY  OF  THE  ALPHA  CHAPTER 

(DICKINSON) 

The  Alpha  Chapter  of  Zeta  Psi,  at  Dickinson  College,  was  estab- 
lished in  1852,  and  was  thus  a  result  of  the  enterprise  of  the  members 
of  the  Fraternity  who,  between  the  date  of  founding  of  the  Fraternity  in 
1847  and  the  beginning  of  the  Civil  War,  extended  the  organization  into 
sixteen  colleges. 

Dickinson  College,  situated  at  Carlisle,  Pennsylvania,  was  founded 
in  1783,  largely  through  the  liberality  and  enthusiastic  support  of  John 
Dickinson,  who  had  been  a  brigadier-general  in  the  war  just  ended,  and 
who  was  at  the  time  Governor  of  Pennsylvania.  For  the  first  fifty  years 
of  its  history  it  was  an  undenominational  institution  with  a  tendency  to- 
wards Presbyterian  control,  a  large  number  of  the  trustees  and  most  of 
the  presidents  belonging  to  that  denomination.  The  college  was  closed 
in  1821  on  account  of  financial  embarrassments,  revived  a  few  years  later, 
closed  again  in  1832,  reopened  a  year  later  under  the  control  of  the 
Methodist  Episcopal  Church,  under  which  control  it  has  continued  with- 
out interruption  to  date,  filling  a  local  need,  and  with  an  attendance  which 
reached  266  students  in  1899-1900. 

The  Alpha  Chapter  was  founded  through  the  activity  of  the  present 
Sigma  Chapter  at  the  University  of  Pennsylvania.  A  committee  con- 
sisting of  Robert  E.  Randall,  Sigma  '53,  and  William  F.  Rogers,  Sigma 
'55,  was  appointed  to  proceed  to  Carlisle  and  formally  establish  the  new 
chapter.  In  March,  1852,  thirteen  men  were  initiated  into  the  Fra- 
ternity, the  first  initiations  being  held  on  March  5.  Of  these  thirteen 
men  William  Tell  Barnitz,  '55,  A.  Signey  Belt,  '54,  James  Taylor  Carlile, 
'52,  together  with  Charles  H.  B.  Lyon,  Sigma  '54,  were  especially  active 
in  organizing  this  nucleus  for  a  chapter.  During  the  first  year  twenty- 
eight  of  the  present  members  of  the  Alpha  Chapter  were  initiated,  and 
four  the  following  year.  They  were  good  men,  representing  the  best 
element  in  college  and  full  of  enthusiasm  for  the  new  organization.  Con- 
ditions, however,  were  unfavorable  for  successful  fraternity  maintenance, 
and  largely  as  a  result  of  the  opposition  of  the  college  authorities,  initi- 
ations ceased,  soon  after  meetings  were  given  up,  and  the  chapter  was 
suspended. 

During  the  short  period  of  two  years  of  activity  of  the  old  Alpha  the 
men  initiated  were  taken  from  all  classes  then  in  college.  Of  the  total 
membership  of  thirty-two,  six  were  from  the  class  of  '52,  six  from  '53, 
five  from  '54,  eight  from  '55  and  seven  from  '56.  Most  of  these  remained 
in  college  until  their  graduation. 

Especially  interesting  is  the  chapter's  record  in  adding  to  the  "Roll 
of  Honor,"  men  who  left  home  and  family  to  fight  for  their  country  in 
the  Civil  War.  Many  of  the  students  at  Dickinson  coming  from  the  South, 
especially  from  Maryland  and  Virginia,  we  find  volunteers  in  both 
armies.  In  the  Confederate  army  were  McCarty,  '52,  lieutenant  from 
Maryland,  killed  in  action;  Harnsberger,  '56,  private  from  Virginia, 
killed  in  action;  Fountain,  '54,  private  from  Maryland,  taken  prisoner 
at  Gettysburg;  Garrison,  '54,  private  from  Virginia,  and  Savage,  '56, 
private  from  Maryland.  The  Alpha  found  representation  in  the  Union 
armies  in  Barnitz,  '55,  captain  U.  S.  Infantry;  Humrich,  '52,  captain  Penn- 
sylvania volunteers,  and  others. 

In  civil  life  several  have  attained  prominence;  among  these  may  be 
mentioned  Judge  Ritchie,  of  the  Supreme  Court  at  Baltimore,  a  well- 
known  democratic  politician,  delegate  to  the  National  Democratic  Con- 
vention of  1888;  Judge  Garrison,  of  the  Virginia  Circuit  Court,  memberof 
U.  S.  House  of  Representatives,  1881-5. 

Of  these  men  added  to  the  rolls  of  Zeta  Psi  nearly  half  acentury  ago, 
time  has  left  but  fourteen,  less  than  one-half,  alive  to-day.

Nelson  Dingley  Jr. 
Founder  of  the  Psi  Chapter 


Rollins  Chapel 


Dartmouth  is  the  oldest  of  the  New  England  colleges,  save  Harvard, 
Yale  and  Brown.  It  was  the  outgrowth  of  a  school  at  Lebanon,  Conn., 
founded  for  the  education  of  Indians.  Samson  Occum,  an  Indian  preacher, 
who  made  a  tour  of  England  in  1765,  was  the  means  of  arousing  great 
interest  in  this  school,  and  a  large  sum  of  money  was  raised  there  for  its 
support.  The  Earl  of  Dartmouth,  who  was  active  in  the  enterprise,  was 
elected  president  and  the  name  changed  to  Dartmouth  College.  The 
charter  of  the  new  institution  was  granted  by  Gov.  John  Wentworth, 
December  13,  1769.  For  a  few  years  the  attendance  was  about  equally 
divided  between  Indians  and  whites,  but  the  number  of  the  former  in 
attendance  soon  diminished  and  the  college  assumed  the  characteristics 
of  the  other  New  England  colleges.  Dartmouth  College  is  beautifully 
situated  in  the  foothills  of  the  White  Mountains  on  the  banks  of  the  Con- 
necticut River,  in  the  town  of  Hanover,  N.  H.  Until  the  past  ten  years 
the  educational  tendency  has  been  very  conservative,  but  changes  have 
been  introduced  during  this  period  and  Dartmouth  is  to-day  fully  abreast 
of  the  times.  In  1899-1900  there  were  752  students  in  attendance. 

A  chapter  of  Zeta  Psi  at  Dartmouth  College  was  authorized  by  the 
Grand  Chapter  at  its  session  August  17-19,  1853,  at  Brooklyn,  N.  Y.,  by 
the  adoption  of  the  following  resolution:  "  Resolved,  That  this  convention 
do  hereby  authorize  the  establishment  of  a  chapter  in  Dartmouth  College, 
but  that  this  permission  shall  not  go  into  effect  until  a  regular  applica- 
tion is  made  from  that  college." 

To  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Grand  Chapter,  the  following  petition 
was  drawn  up  and  presented:  "The  undersigned,  undergraduates  of 
Dartmouth  College,  located  in  Hanover,  Grafton  County,  New  Hampshire, 
would  most  respectfully  petition  the  Grand  Chapter  of  the  Zeta  Psi  Fra- 
ternity of  the  United  States  of  North  America,  to  grant  them  and  their 
associates  a  charter  for  a  chapter  of  said  fraternity  to  be  located  in 
Dartmouth  College,  and  to  be  subject  to  such  regulations  as  the  constitu- 
tion and  laws  of  said  fraternity  may  require.  Dartmouth  College,  October 
22,  1853.  Nelson  Dingley,  Jr.,  Daniel  Stearns,  Oliver  Parker  Rogers, 
William  Smith  Leonard,  Nathaniel  Stone  Simpkins,  Jr.,  Henry  Foster 
Anderson. ' ' 

This  petition  was  granted  by  the  Grand  Officers  in  accordance  with 
the  action  of  the  Grand  Chapter  in  the  following:  "Official  Sanction. 
Know  all  that  we,  the  Grand  Chapter  of  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity  of  North 
America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  in  us  reposed,  do  hereby  grant  unto 
N.  Dingley,  Jr.,  Daniel  Stearns,  O.  P.  Rogers,  W.  S.  Leonard,  N.  S. 
Simpkins,  Jr.,  and  H.  F.  Anderson,  and  to  such  as  may  become  asso- 
ciated with  them,  permission  to  institute  a  chapter  of  the  above  fraternity 
in  Dartmouth  College,  located  at  Hanover,  N.  H. ;  and  when  it  shall  be 
represented  to  us  that  a  chapter  has  been  duly  established  in  said  col- 
lege we  hereby  engage  to  execute  a  charter  in  due  form,  whereby  the 
said  chapter  shall  be  invested  with  all  the  privileges  and  subject  to  all 
the  regulations  of  any  chapter  of  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity.  In  testimony 
of  this  we  have  subscribed  our  names  this  twenty-fifth  day  of  October, 
A.  D.,  One  Thousand  Eight  Hundred  and  Fifty-three.  P.  W.  Rouse, 
E  A,  and  John  W.  Bennett,  F  A." 

According  to  previous  notice  the  petitioners  assembled  in  the  old 
Dartmouth  Hotel  at  Hanover  at  9  p.  M.,  November  19,  1853,  where  they 
were  met  by  C.  W.  Lander,  W.  H.  Baldwin,  H.  W.  Richardson  and  S. 
R.  Thurston,  members  of  the  Chi  Chapter,  who,  after  presenting  creden- 
tials and  verifying  the  identity  of  the  petitioners,  proceeded  to  establish 


386  PSI  CHAPTER   (DARTMOUTH) 

the  new  chapter  by  initiating-  the  petitioners  and  duly  instructing  them 
in  the  duties  and  responsibilities  of  membership  in  the  Zeta  Psi  Fra- 
ternity. Six  men  were  initiated  charter  members  of  the  new  chapter, 
namely,  the  five  petitioners  above-named  (Nelson  Dingley,  Jr.,  had  al- 
ready been  initiated  at  the  Chi  Chapter  at  Colby  University)  and  James 
Edwin  Johnson,  who  was  associated  with,  but  not  actually  petitioning 
with  the  others. 

The  Psi  Chapter  was  fortunate  in  having1  for  founder  one  who  was 
destined  to  lead  a  career  of  great  honor  and  preeminent  usefulness  to  his 
country.  Nelson  Dingley,  Jr.,  was  initiated  March  14,  1852,  at  Colby 
College,  where  he  spent  the  first  two  years  (1851-3)  of  his  college  course. 
He  removed  to  Dartmouth  in  1853,  where  he  was  graduated  at  commence- 
ment, 1855.  It  wasno  doubt  largely  due  to  his  energy  and  enthusiasm  that 
there  was  gathered  immediately  after  his  coming  to  Hanover  the  nucleus 
for  the  new  chapter. 

For  some  reason  not  clear  at  present,  the  existence  of  the  chapter  was 
not  made  known  until  the  fall  of  1854,  and  but  few  meetings  were  held 
during  this  first  year.  The  chapter  was,  however,  firmly  established  by 
this  time,  and  at  once  received  the  recognition  of  the  college  community 
and  took  its  position  with  the  four  other  fraternities.  The  chapter  con- 
tinued an  active  and  honorable  career  until  about  1864,  when  meetings 
were  given  up  and  the  chapter  was  discontinued. 

From  1853  to  1860  the  average  number  initiated  each  year  was  ten, 
two  were  initiated  in  1861,  none  in  1862,  and  two  joined  the  chapter  in 
1863,  one  of  whom  was  from  the  Theta  Chapter  at  Union  College.  During 
this  period  the  chapter  was  represented  at  almost  every  Grand  Chapter 
meeting,  the  delegates  and  other  members  often  taking  a  leading  part  in 
the  proceedings.  In  1860  the  Grand  Chapter  met  at  Hanover,  where  the 
delegates  were  hospitably  entertained  by  the  Psi  Chapter.  The  exact 
reason  for  the  failure  to  continue  after  1864  is  not  quite  clear,  but  it  may 
have  resulted  from  a  tendency  noticed  at  Dartmouth  at  this  time  to  intro- 
duce the  system  of  class  fraternities — a  system  not  conducive  to  the  best 
results  in  the  case  of  a  fraternity  based  upon  an  association  not  merely 
transient  and  local  in  character. 

The  chapter  remained  dormant  until  1871,  when  an  attempt  was 
made  to  reestablish  it  on  a  permanent  basis.  Authority  having  been  duly 
granted  by  the  Grand  Chapter,  on  May  6,  1871,  Reuben  Wesley  Dunn, 
'68,  Chi;  Henry  Francis  Harris,  '71,  Kappa,  and  Joseph  Sargent  Dun- 
ham, '71,  Kappa,  together  with  two  members  of  the  fraternity,  students 
at  Dartmouth,  Stephen  Alfred  Jones,  '72,  Chi,  through  whose  efforts  the 
nucleus  for  the  reestablishment  was  gathered  together,  and  Everett  Tot- 
man,  '72,  Lambda,  initiated  nine  men,  all  Sophomores  of  the  class  of  1873. 
Although  the  chapter  continued  active  for  two  years  until  commencement, 
1873,  these  were  the  only  initiations  in  this  attempt  at  reestablishment. 

A  report  to  the  Grand  Chapter  at  its  meeting,  December  31,  1873, 
January  1,  1874,  at  Easton,  Pa.,  states  that  "the  society  system  of  Dart- 
mouth College  is  peculiar  to  itself,  and  in  direct  opposition  to  that  article 
of  our  constitution  regulating  such  matters."  It  was  thought  best  by  the 
active  members  to  let  the  chapter  die  an  honorable  death,  and  at  com- 
mencement, June,  1873,  all  of  the  active  members  were  graduated  and  the 
chapter  ceased  to  exist.  Of  a  total  membership  of  ninety-eight,  thirty- 
seven  are  deceased;  three  were  enrolled  from  the  Chi  Chapter,  Colby;  one 
from  the  Lambda,  Bowdoin,  and  one  from  the  Theta,  Union.

HISTORY  OF  THE  KAPPA  CHAPTER 

Tufts  College  was  founded  in  1852,  and  graduated  its  first  class  in 
1857.  While  the  origin  and  growth  of  the  institution  have  been  largely 
due  to  members  of  the  Universalist  denomination,  the  purpose  of  the  col- 
lege is  broadly  non- sectarian;  its  Faculty  and  students  hold  relations 
with  various  religious  sects.  At  present,  in  addition  to  the  College  of 
Liberal  Arts,  there  is  a  Divinity  School,  a  Medical  School  and  a  Dental 
School.  The  student  roll  in  all  departments  numbers  about  seven  hun- 
dred, and  more  than  eighty  persons  are  engaged  in  giving  instruction. 
It  is  situated  about  four  miles  from  Boston,  on  the  Northern  Division  of 
the  Boston  and  Maine  Railroad. 

The  Kappa  Chapter  of  Zeta  Psi  represents  the  oldest  fraternity  at 
Tufts.  It  was  founded  in  1855  by  Robert  McNeil  Morse,  Jr.,  later  a 
member  of  the  Massachusetts  Senate,  and  John  Lamson  Flagg,  at  one 
time  Mayor  of  Troy,  N.  Y.,  both  being  of  the  class  of  '57,  Harvard  Uni- 
versity, and  of  the  Rho  Chapter.  To  Benjamin  Allen  Hathaway,  Tufts 
'58,  was  entrusted  the  duty  of  choosing  the  charter  members.  The 
original  members,  besides  Bro.  Hathaway,  were  Herman  Joseph  Smith, 
Henry  Bacon  Brown,  William  Henry  Hobbs,  John  Collins  Redman,  John 
F.  Wood,  and  Thomas  Sydenham  Bridgham,  the  last-named  being  elected 
at  the  second  meeting.  Naturally,  Bro.  Hathaway  has  continued  to  be 
regarded  with  veneration  by  the  long  line  of  Kappa  men,  both  for  his 
early  services  and  for  the  interest  which  he  has  manifested  in  the  chap- 
ter until  the  present  day.  It  is  pleasant  to  read  in  the  early  letters  on 
file  the  official  and  friendly  encouragement  of  Bro.  Morse  when  at  Cam- 
bridge. The  Kappa  was  able  to  reciprocate  the  good  spirit  of  the 
Rho  when,  near  the  close  of  the  civil  war,  attempt  was  made  to  establish 
the  Rho  more  firmly.  H.  P.  Makechnie,  Tufts  '65,  now  a  physician  in 
West  Somerville,  Mass.,  was  at  that  time  $  of  the  Kappa,  and  was 
active  in  obtaining  from  the  sister  chapters  their  commendation  of  the 
Rho.  In  1864  Dr.  Makechnie  secured  needed  legislation  for  the  Kappa 
from  the  Grand  Chapter. 

The  civil  war  breaking  out,  all  but  two  members  of  the  Kappa  laid 
down  their  books  to  be  enrolled  in  the  service  of  their  country.  The  class 
of  '58  sent  to  the  front  B.  A.  Hathaway,  private  Company  D,  38th  Mass. 
Volunteer  Infantry;  Herman  Joseph  Smith,  assistant  surgeon  5th  U.  S. 
C.  C. ;  Henry  Bowers  Walton,  1st  lieutenant  Company  D,  12th  Me. 
Volunteer  Infantry,  who  was  killed  at  Cedar  Creek,  Oct.  19,  1864.  From 
the  class  of  '59  went  Thomas  Orville  Seaver,  colonel  in  3d  Regiment  of 
Vt.  Volunteer  Infantry,  and  Selden  Connor,  brigadier-general  of  Me. 
Volunteers,  who  was  afterward  for  three  terms  Governor  of  Maine. 
The  class  of  '60  furnished  George  Curtis  Waldo,  private  Conn.  Volun- 
teers; Lorin  Low  Dame,  1st  lieutenant  15th  Mass.  Battery,  and  Oliver 
Hawkes  Lowell,  captain  Company  H,  16th  Me.  Volunteer  Infantry,  who 
was  wounded  at  Gettysburg,  July  1,  1863,  and  who  died  on  the  following 
day.  Philo  Hersey,  lieutenant-colonel  Me.  Volunteers,  represented  the 
class  of  '61.  Albion  Thorne,  1st  lieutenant  Company  C,  23d  Me.  Vol- 
unteer Infantry;  Benjamin  Franklin  Heald,  sergeant,  2d  and  1st  lieu- 
tenant Me.  Volunteer  Infantry,  and  Eldridge  Hazen  Dearborn,  private 
Company  G,  16th  N.  H.  Volunteer  Infantry,  served  for  the  class  of  '62. 
While  '63  contributed  Horatio  Bisbee,  colonel  9th  Me.  Volunteer  Infantrj-; 
Rienzi  Loud,  1st  lieutenant  in  5th  Mass.  Cavalry  (colored),  and  Henry 
Lyon,  Company  A,  44th  Regiment,  Mass.  Volunteer  Infantry.  All  of 
these  men  who  were  spared  to  return  have  since  taken  honorable  place 
in  their  chosen  callings,  and  some  of  them  have  attained  eminence.  At 
the  expense  of  chronological  sequence  this  roll  of  honor  should  be  extended 


404  KAPPA  CHAPTER 

to  include  the  name  of  William  Roger  Dunham,  of  the  class  of  '95,  who 
enlisted  in  the  late  war  with  Spain,  and,  returning-  home  on  a  furlough, 
died  at  Barre,  Vt. 

Naturally  enough,  the  current  interest  in  the  war  was  so  intense  as 
to  make  society  matters  almost  forgotten.  After  the  graduation  of  the 
class  of  '62,  regular  meetings  were  discontinued.  But  there  were  two 
enthusiastic  Zetes  left,  who  held  frequent  meetings  and  consultation  con- 
cerning means  of  restoring  the  Tufts  Chapter  to  its  old-time  strength. 
On  Sept.  12,  1864,  through  the  prolonged  efforts  of  Bros.  Makechnie  and 
B.  P.  Kinsman,  '65,  a  meeting  was  held  at  which  nine  members,  constitu- 
ting an  existing  local  society,  entered  the  Kappa  Chapter  in  a  body.  The 
Epsilon  Chapter,  of  Brown  University,  whose  relations  with  the  Kappa 
have  always  been  singularly  cordial,  by  invitation  conducted  the  initia- 
tion ceremony,  and  the  following  men  were  made  Zetes,  according  to  the 
ancient  order:  C.  C.  Jenks,  C.  E.  Ridler,  Rev.  E.  C.  Sweetser,  the  brothers 
W.  P.  and  Z.  L.  White,  and  N.  Elliott,  all  of  the  class  of  '66;  Almon 
Gunnison,  now  President  of  St.  Lawrence  University,  and  P.  J.  Larra- 
bee,  of  '67;  and  J.  Emery,  Jr.,  of  '68.  Other  members  were  rapidly  added, 
so  that  the  disagreeable  experiences  of  war  time  were  never  repeated. 
But  the  chain,  though  far  stretched,  had  never  been  broken.  The  existence 
of  the  Kappa  has  been  continuous  since  its  organization,  and  the  chapter 
has  faithfully  striven  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Constitution  and 
customs  of  Zeta  Psi. 

An  account  of  the  life  of  the  chapter  from  1864  to  the  present  would 
involve  reference  to  the  exercises  held  within  its  walls  and  to  various 
interests  of  the  college  at  large.  Concerning  the  inner  life  of  the  chapter, 
it  may  truly  be  said  that  it  has  always  shown  vitality,  and,  while  not 
turning  aside  from  occasional  relaxation  in  amusement,  it  has  main- 
tained its  literary  exercises  according  to  a  creditable  standard.  It  is 
interesting  to  observe  in  this  connection  the  change  in  the  fashion  of 
questions  for  debate,  from  "Resolved,  that  Washington  was  a  greater  man 
intellectually  than  Napoleon,"  to  the  more  practical  questions  of  the 
present  day.  Besides  the  variety  of  its  literary  programs,  the  Kappa 
has  shown  active  interest  in  music.  Bros.  Leo  R.  Lewis,  '87,  and  E. 
W.  Newton,  '90,  have  written  songs  both  for  the  fraternity  and  the 
college,  the  former  having  also  rendered  valuable  service  in  connection 
with  the  fraternity  song-books,  and  a  collection  of  "Tufts  Songs,"  pub- 
lished by  the  class  of  '95.  Both  of  these  Brothers  have  directed  the  col- 
lege musical  clubs  with  marked  success. 

It  may  be  set  down  as  one  of  the  prominent  characteristics  of  the 
chapter  that  it  is  interested  not  only  in  its  own  affairs,  but  in  the  affairs 
of  the  college  at  large.  This  may  be  due  in  part  to  the  fact  that  it  was 
first  to  occupy  the  ground,  and  for  many  years  had  but  one  rival  frater- 
nity at  hand.  A  chapter  of  this  rivalry  relates  to  the  literary  organ  of 
the  college,  the  Tuftonian,  at  first  an  annual,  issued  by  the  two  socie- 
ties conjointly  from  1864  till  1872.  Owing  to  a  disagreement  the  rival 
fraternity  withdrew,  to  issue  an  annual  of  its  own,  while  from  1872  to 
1877  the  Tuftonian  was  managed  and  published  by  Zeta  Psi  alone.  The 
rivalry  between  these  two  fraternities  continued  to  be  waged  about  the 
college  paper  when  it  became  a  monthly  and  then  a  semimonthly.  In  1883 
an  aggressive  war  was  fought  to  capture  equal  representation  on  the  edito- 
rial staff  of  the  paper,  the  result  being  the  election  to  the  position  of 
editor-in-chief  of  Bro.  F.  E.  Snow,  '83,  since  which  time  Zeta  Psi 
has  had  no  good  reason  to  complain  of  a  lack  of  proportional  represen- 
tation. A  similar  story  might  be  told  of  athletics,  the  make-up  of  the 
musical  clubs,  the  several  dramatic  ventures  which  have  been  made,  the 
class  annuals  and  the  record  in  general  scholarship.  About  one-third 
of  the  members  of  the  local  chapter  of  Phi  Beta  Kappa  are  Zetes.  Per- 
haps it  is  fitting  to  add  that  the  Faculty  of  the  College  of  Letters  now 
includes  five  members  of  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity,  four  being  previous 
members  of  the  Kappa  Chapter,  and  the  fifth  being  Benjamin  G.  Brown, 


KAPPA  CHAPTER  405 

"Walker  Professor  of  Mathematics,  Harvard  '58.  It  is  not  too  much  to 
say,  therefore,  that  the  place  maintained  by  the  Kappa  Chapter  through 
the  forty-four  years  of  its  life  in  Tufts  College  is  an  honorable  one. 

It  remains  to  speak  of  the  relation  of  the  Kappa  Chapter  to  the 
Grand  Chapter  and  to  the  world.  For  particulars  concerning  the  sta- 
tions in  the  world's  work  that  have  been  occupied  and  are  now  being 
occupied  by  graduates  of  the  Kappa,  reference  must  be  made  to  the 
sketches  of  individuals,  to  be  found  elsewhere  in  this  volume.  To  the 
Grand  Chapter  the  relations  of  the  Kappa  have  been  usually  of  the 
pleasantest  character.  The  method  of  establishment  was  regarded  as 
irregular,  but  in  1856  the  Convention,  after  some  delay,  duly  recog- 
nized the  Kappa  as  legally  a  chapter  of  the  fraternity.  And  when,  in 
1883,  an  attempt  was  made  to  revoke  the  charter  of  the  Kappa,  the  inves- 
tigating committee,  making  no  report,  was  officially  censured.  In  the 
following  year  the  Convention  was  held  under  the  auspices  of  the  Kappa 
and  Lambda  Chapters.  In  1891,  one  Brother  made  a  single-handed  at- 
tack; but  he  stood  alone,  while  the  Kappa  was  sustained  by  the  other- 
wise unanimous  vote  of  the  Grand  Chapter.  Thus  prompt  vindication 
has  in  each  case  followed  attack.  Further,  the  Kappa  has  furnished 
the  following  officers  to  the  Grand  Chapter  :  3?  A,  William  Adams  John- 
son, '60,  and  William  Cowan  Prescott,  '71;  A  $  A,  Frank  Mortimer 
Hawes,  '72,  and  Charles  H.  Eaton,  '74;  $  A,  Horace  Perkins  Makech- 
nie,  '65;  2  p  A,  Benjamin  Allen  Hathaway,  '58,  Charles  Calvin  Jenks, 
'64,  Zebulon  Lewis  White,  '66,  and  Frederick  Washington  Tibbetts,  '79. 
Thrice  has  the  Kappa  furnished  the  orator  for  the  Convention,  Z.  L. 
White  in  1875,  and  Rev.  C.  H.  Eaton,  D.D.,  in  1897  and  in  1899. 

The  principal  body  of  Kappa  alumni  is  the  New  England  division, 
with  its  headquarters  in  Boston. 

The  last  chapter  in  the  history  of  the  Kappa  is  perhaps  the  most 
important,  as  it  relates  to  the  acquisition  of  a  permanent  chapter  house. 
In  the  first  year  of  the  Kappa's  life,  its  meetings  were  held  in  college 
rooms.  On  Dec.  10,  1856,  an  abiding-place  was  discovered  in  a  wooden 
house  just  off  the  college  grounds.  Later,  the  chapter  moved  to  two  rooms 
obtained  in  Usher's  Block,  Medford,  which  rooms  are  associated  with 
more  than  thirty  years  of  initiation  ceremonies  and  fraternal  meetings. 
These  rooms,  gradually  having  been  suitably  furnished,  served  their 
purpose  until  1894,  when,  for  four  years,  the  chapter  rented  more 
elegant  lodge-rooms  in  Cambridge  and  in  West  Somerville.  But  in  later 
years  the  feeling  had  often  been  entertained  that  a  permanent  residence 
on  or  near  the  college  grounds  was  essential  to  maintaining  the  dignity 
of  the  fraternity.  More  than  one  attempt  was  made  to  crystallize  these 
desires  into  tangible  form.  At  length,  at  the  suggestion  of  some  of  the 
prominent  graduate  members,  Bro.  A.  W.  De  Goosh,  '93,  began  the 
work  of  soliciting  subscriptions  for  the  capital  stock  of  a  corporation,  to 
be  organized  in  order  to  provide  a  suitable  home  for  the  Kappa.  The 
recent  period  of  financial  depression  retarded  the  fruitage  of  his  faithful 
and  sagacious  labof ,  but  at  last  a  suitable  house  has  been  obtained  in 
the  former  dwelling  of  Prof.  W.  R.  Shipman,  who  has  always  been  sym- 
pathetically disposed  toward  Zeta  Psi,  and  whose  son  has  been  received 
into  her  ranks.  The  house  is  very  substantially  built,  with  spacious 
rooms,  affording  not  only  accommodation  for  the  formal  meetings  of  the 
chapter,  but  also  reception  rooms  for  social  purposes,  and  dormitories 
for  six  students.  Already  the  unification  of  the  social  life  of  the  chapter 
has  been  begun,  a  library  has  been  started,  and  the  present  member- 
ship is  congratulating  itself  upon  its  improved  standing  among  the  other 
fraternities  of  the  college.  And  the  outlook  is  hopeful  for  the  continued 
welfare  and  growth  of  the  Kappa  Chapter.

HISTORY  OF  THE  THETA  CHAPTER 

The  first  petition  for  a  charter  for  Union  College— the  home  of  the 
Theta  Chapter  of  Zeta  Psi — was  presented  to  the  Legislature  in  1779  and 
was  based  upon  "the  need  that  now  exists  and  will  hereafter  exist  for 
men  of  learning  to  fill  the  various  offices  of  church  and  state."  The 
petition  was  denied  because  of  lack  of  assurance  of  sufficient  financial 
support,  but  was  renewed  year  after  year,  and  in  1783  an  Academy  was 
chartered,  which  in  1795  received  a  full  college  charter  from  the  newly 
instituted  Board  of  Regents  of  the  University  of  the  State  of  New  York. 
All  the  circumstances  connected  with  the  origin  of  Union  College  give 
force  to  the  claim  that  it  was  the  first  college  in  America  that  grew  out 
of  the  needs  of  the  new  national  life  and  expressed  the  national  spirit. 
Its  very  name  indicates  this,  as  it  was  intended  to  indicate  freedom  from 
denominational  control,  showing  that  its  aim  was  the  service  of  the  state 
rather  than  of  the  church;  and  through  all  its  history  Union  has  been 
true  to  this  original  purpose.  From  1795  to  1804  the  college  grew  but 
slowly.  In  the  latter  year,  however,  the  Rev.  Eliphalet  Nott,  pastor  of 
the  First  Presbyterian  Church  of  Albany,  was  called  to  the  presidency, 
and  with  him  began  the  vigorous  life  which  for  more  than  half  a  century 
made  it  one  of  the  best-known  colleges  in  the  land.  Dr.  Nott  was  presi- 
dent until  his  death  in  1866,  or  for  a  period  of  sixty-two  years.  His 
strong  and  inspiring  personality  drew  students  from  every  section  of  the 
country,  many  even  leaving  other  colleges  that  they  might  spend  their 
senior  year  at  Union.  His  administration  was  characterized  by  a  policy 
so  broad  that  it  antagonized  the  conservatism  of  other  institutions,  but 
time  has  vindicated  his  wisdom.  Union  has  the  distinction  of  being 
the  first  American  college  to  introduce  the  study  of  modern  languages, 
the  first  to  establish  a  scientific  course  and  the  first  to  found  an  en- 
gineering school.  The  college  suffered  greatly  by  the  Civil  War,  and 
after  the  death  of  President  Nott  it  passed  through  many  trying  expe- 
riences, but  is  now,  under  President  Raymond,  established  upon  a  sub- 
stantial basis  with  every  prospect  of  a  steady  and  permanent  growth. 

The  oldest  of  the  Greek-letter  fraternities  originated  at  Union,  the 
first  in  1825,  the  second  in  1827,  the  third  in  1828.  These  antedate  all 
others  and  were  followed  by  three  others  in  1833,  in  1841  and  in  1847, 
respectively.  It  is  safe  to  say  that  no  other  college  has  given  birth  to  so 
many  well-known  fraternities.  Seven  other  fraternities,  originating 
elsewhere,  have  had  chapters  at  Union.  Of  these  all  but  the  first  two 
are  still  in  existence. 

The  Theta  Chapter  of  Zeta  Psi  was  founded  at  Union,  March  4, 
1856.  Its  founders  were  three  members  of  the  Chi  Chapter  of  Waterville 
College,  Me.,  William  H.  Baldwin,  Charles  W.  Sanger  and  Clinton 
Howe.  Bro.  Sanger,  in  a  recent  letter,  gives  this  interesting  account  of 
the  circumstances  attending  its  birth:  "In  1855  Clint.  Howe  and  I 
were  members  of  Chi  Chapter  at  Waterville  College  (now  Colby).  He 
was  a  sophomore  and  I  a  junior  and  we  were  close  and  intimate 
friends.  At  the  end  of  that  college  year  we  both  left  Waterville  for 
Union — and  for  much  the  same  cause.  At  that  time  Harrington  and 
McClure,  both  fine  fellows,  were  preparing  for  college  under  Lander,  a 
member  of  Chi,  intending  to  enter  at  Waterville,  and  we  had  our  eyes  on 
them  for  future  members.  They,  however,  changed  their  minds  and 
went  to  Union.  I  did  not  go  to  Union  until  January,  1856.  Clint,  had 
been  there  for  one  full  term.  We  at  once  commenced  looking  about  us 
for  suitable  men  to  form  a  chapter.  Harrington  and  McClure  were  sure, 
in  fact  had  been  captured  while  in  the  preparatory  school,  intending  to 
enter  at  Waterville.  Piper  and  Prentice  were  from  Maine  and  we  knew 
them  or  of  them.  Morey  and  Shepard,  Wilkie  and  Jones,  we  became 


446  THETA  CHAPTER 

acquainted  with  and  judged  worthy.  Frank  Leonard  came  to  us  a 
member  from  Brown.  McClure  was  never  initiated  and  for  this  reason: 
at  the  commencement  of  the  winter  term,  in  January,  1856,  he  started 
from  home  on  his  return  to  college  but  mysteriously  disappeared  and 
never  reached  Schenectady  at  all.  I  do  not  know  to  this  day  what  be- 
came of  him.  We  entered  him,  however,  as  a  charter  member,  knowing 
that  he  would  have  been  one  if  he  had  returned  to  college.  When  we 
were  ready  to  organize  the  chapter  we  sent  for  Bro.  Bill  Baldwin,  a  '55 
graduate  of  Waterville,  to  come  and  help  us  and  add  the  dignity  of  his 
superior  year  to  our  performance. ' ' 

With  his  promising  beginning  the  Theta  Chapter  increased  and 
multiplied  and  went  on  "prospering  and  to  prosper."  It  was  never  the 
policy  of  those  who  directed  its  fortunes  to  aim  primarily — as  some  of 
their  sister  fraternities  seemed  to  do — at  having  a  large  chapter.  Dr. 
Johnson,  in  urging  the  claims  of  Boswell  for  membership  in  one  of  the 
clubs  to  which  he  belonged,  declared  that  Boswell  was  "clubable. " 
The  Theta  Chapter,  during  all  the  years  of  its  history,  was  made  up  of 
"clubable  "  men,  men  devoted  to  the  interests  of  the  fraternity,  of  the 
chapter,  and  of  one  another.  The  decline  and  fall  of  the  chapter  were 
due  to  causes  outside  of  itself,  causes  which  in  no  way  reflect  upon 
Theta.  The  war  between  the  sections,  which  began  in  1861,  had  a  disas- 
trous effect  upon  Union  College.  Previous  to  that  time  it  always  had  a 
large  number  of  Southern  students  upon  its  roll.  But  with  the  breaking 
out  of  hostilities  this  important  element  was  lost  to  the  institution. 
Later,  when  Union  was  gradually  recovering  from  this  blow,  she  suf- 
fered from  internal  dissensions  which  did  not  a  little  to  handicap  her 
prosperity.  Owing  to  these  untoward  circumstances  the  Theta  Chapter 
apparently  ceased  to  exist  early  in  the  Seventies.  J.  C.  Hossiter,  in 
response  to  an  inquiry  addressed  to  him,  wrote:  "  I  was  the  last 
member  initiated  into  Theta  Chapter  in  1871 — I  graduated  that  year." 

We  say  that  the  Theta  "apparently"  came  to  an  end  early  in  the 
Seventies.  We  use  this  qualifying  word  because  it  is  to  be  hoped  that 
the  near  future  may  demonstrate  that  she  is  not  dead,  but  merely  sleep- 
ing. Why  should  not  the  Theta,  now  that  Union  has  entered  upon  a 
new  era  of  prosperity,  be  reestablished  at  that  venerable  institution? 
We  press  home  the  question  upon  the  attention  of  the  surviving  members 
of  the  Theta  and  upon  "Zetes"  generally.

HISTORY  OF  THE  TAU  CHAPTER 

The  first  organized  movement  to  establish  a  college  at  Easton,  Pa., 
was  a  meeting  held  in  1824,  at  which  it  was  resolved,  "That  James  M. 
Porter,  Joel  Jones  and  Jacob  Wagner,  be  a  committee  to  draft  a  memorial 
to  the  Legislature  for  a  charter  of  incorporation  and  for  legislative  aid." 
In  1826  the  charter  was  granted,  and  the  Board  of  Trustees  elected  James 
M.  Porter,  president,  and  Col.  Thomas  McKeen,  treasurer,  though  actual 
work  in  the  classroom  was  not  started  until  1832.  Rev.  George  Junkin, 
A.  M.,  accepted  the  presidency,  and  successfully  launched  the  new  insti- 
tution through  many  discouragements.  The  original  idea  of  the  founders 
was  to  have  a  seven-years'  course,  which  should  include  military  instruc- 
tion and  manual  training,  so  that  students  might  be  received  with  no  other 
previous  qualifications  than  the  rudiments  of  an  English  education. 
From  the  very  beginning  the  modern  languages  were  to  be  insisted  upon, 
and  the  outgrowth  of  this  interest  has  been  the  unsurpassed  position 
the  college  has  attained  through  the  work  of  Prof.  Francis  A.  March, 
LL.D.,  D.  C.  L.  As  a  location  for  a  seat  of  learning,  Easton  possesses 
many  advantages,  lying,  as  it  does,  in  a  most  healthful  district  seventy- 
five  miles  west  of  New  York  and  sixty  miles  north  of  Philadelphia,  and 
as  a  railroad  centre  with  three  trunk  lines  leading  to  the  west.  Lafayette 
yields  to  few  if  any  in  charm  and  grandeur  of  situation,  and  looks  down 
upon  the  beauties  of  Easton  in  the  valley,  as  Edinburgh  University 
looks  down  upon  its  parent  city. 

Always  in  the  hands  of  Presbyterians,  though  non-sectarian  at  first, 
the  college  was  formally  connected  with  the  Synod  of  Philadelphia  of 
the  Presbyterian  Church  in  1850.  The  college  suffered  severely  during 
the  period"  of  the  Civil  War,  26  per  cent,  of  the  graduates  and  a  large 
percentage  of  the  students  having  entered  the  service  of  the  United  States. 
A  monument  on  the  hillside,  overlooking  the  city,  was  erected  to  the  fallen 
heroes  by  the  Alumni  Association  in  1866.  Under  the  presidency  of  Dr. 
Wm.  C.  Cattell,  elected  in  1863,  the  Pardee  Scientific  Department  was 
established,  and  the  college  gained,  through  his  untiring  efforts  during 
twenty  years,  friends,  money  and  students,  and  has  been  for  a  generation 
reckoned  as  one  of  the  small  colleges  of  the  country  whose  atmosphere  is 
one  of  serious  work,  and  whose  Alumni  have  taken  the  highest  stand  in  all 
the  various  walks  of  life;  and  the  college  to-day  stands  forth  as  one  of  the 
strongest  arguments  in  favor  of  individual  instruction  at  the  small  college 
over  the  broader  scheme  adopted  in  the  large  universities.  The  number 
of  students  now  is  about  300.  As  said  by  one  of  our  ablest  elders,  this 
has  been  the  century  of  affiliation  and  brotherhood  throughout  all  the 
strata  of  life,  and  the  colleges  were  in  no  way  exempt,  so  that  we  are  not 
at  all  surprised  to  read  that  the  Convention  of  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity, 
held  in  New  York,  August  26-28,  1857,  received  a  petition  from  students 
at  Lafayette  and  voted  to  grant  them  a  charter.  Under  this  authority, 
on  Friday  evening,  October  2,  1857,  William  Platt  Pepper  and  Henry 
Ashurst,  from  the  Sigma  Chapter,  a  committee  appointed  for  the  purpose 
by  the  Grand  chapter,  founded  the  chapter  of  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity 
at  Lafayette  College,  which  was  subsequently  given  the  name  of  Tau. 
On  that  evening  four  men  were  initiated,  and  they  formed  the  nucleus  from 
which  the  future  chapter,  together  with  its  attendant  reputation  and  re- 
sults, was  to  grow.  These  men  were  C.  S.  McConnick,  William  A. 
Wurts,  Isaac  X.  Grier  and  Jacob  A.  Miller. 

The  infant  chapter  held  its  first  independent  meeting  on  the  next 
evening,  October  3,  1857.  At  this  meeting  one  other  member  was  elected, 
Bro.  E.  W.  Hays,  who  was  initiated  at  the  next  meeting.  The  initial 
meeting  had  been  held  in  one  of  the  dormitory  rooms  of  what  is  now  known 


458  TAU  CHAPTER 

as  South  College.  But  shortly  a  room  was  procured  in  the  United  States 
Hotel,  where  the  chapter  held  its  meeting's  for  some  time.  Strict  secrecy 
was  absolutely  necessary,  as  the  college  authorities  and  public  opinion 
condemned  and  forbade  the  very  existence  of  all  fraternities.  After  this 
period  the  meetings  were  held  in  various  places.  Many  were  the  devices 
used  to  elude  the  prying  curiosity  of  foe  and  faculty.  But  not  even  the 
ban  of  that  learned  body,  or  the  hostility  of  people  at  large,  was  able  to 
prevent  the  furtherance  of  real  good;  and  so  the  chapter  grew. 

The  Tau  took  very  active  interest  in  the  establishment  of  the  Omicron 
Chapter  at  Princeton,  and  by  reason  of  the  excessive  anti-fraternity 
feeling  at  Princeton,  very  frequently  initiated  members  for  the  Omicron. 
In  July,  1861,  the  Tau  wrote  out  the  constitution  and  by-laws  for  the 
chapter  at  Gettysburg. 

The  agitation  of  the  country  during  the  Civil  War  affected  every 
interest,  and  in  this  the  Tau  was  not  excepted.  It  appears,  however, 
that  this  unsettled  condition  of  affairs  did  not  affect  the  standard  of  the 
chapter  in  any  respect,  for  during  this  period  some  of  the  best  men  that 
the  Tau  has  ever  known  were  joined  to  its  ranks.  In  the  War  the  Tau 
was  well  represented,  and  out  of  the  first  68  men  initiated  up  to  1868, 
23  men  served  their  country  in  various  branches  of  the  service,  Gen. 
Frank  Reeder,  '63,  reaching  the  rank  of  lieut. -colonel  of  cavalry; 
Judge  Howard  J.  Reeder  the  rank  of  captain  of  infantry,  and  Major  A. 
B.  Howell,  '68,  the  rank  of  sergeant  in  N.  Y.  Cavalry,  where  he  lost 
a  leg.  Several  were  lieutenants;  a  number  were  non-commissioned 
officers,  not  to  mention  the  worthy  privates  who  were  just  as  devotedly 
loyal.  Bro.  John  Hecht  Buckley,  '63,  enlisted  in  129th  Pa.  Infantry, 
and  lost  his  life  at  Sharpsburg,  Md.,  and  with  other  Sons  of  Lafayette 
holds  a  place  in  loving  remembrance. 

In  the  Spanish-American  war  of  1898,  while  our  records  are  not 
made  up  at  this  time,  the  names  of  several  Tau  men  appear  among  the 
few  who  were  allowed  to  serve  their  country  in  that  short  war.  Bro. 
Russell  B.  Harrison,  '77,  was  and  is  still  major  of  volunteers,  serving  in 
Cuba  with  great  credit  and  distinction  as  major  and  inspector-gen.  U. 
S.  Army,  and  provost-marshal  7th  Army  Corps.  Gen.  Lee  said  that  he 
had  "  been  very  fortunate  in  having  a  very  efficient  provost-marshal  in 
Major  Harrison."  He  was  the  first  American  commander  of  Morro 
Castle.  Dr.  W.  E.  Parker,  '88,  was  ass't  surgeon,  with  rank  of  first- 
lieutenant,  under  Gen.  Shafter,  at  Santiago,  and  until  he  contracted  the 
same  disease  was  in  full  charge  of  the  Santiago  yellow  fever  hospital 
at  Daiquiri.  After  his  recovery,  he  brought  home  the  transport  "Berk- 
shire" with  a  loss  of  but  three  men,  though  150  were  so  ill  as  to  have  been 
carried  aboard.  Bro.  Geo.  R.  McLean,  '95,  went  out  with  the  9th  Pa. 
Vols.,  as  lieutenant,  and  attained  the  rank  of  captain,  while  serving  as 
aide  on  the  brigade  staff.  Bro.  Harry  W.  Chamberlain,  '92,  served  as 
1st  lieutenant  in  Co.  D,  12th  Regt.  Inf.,  Pa.  Vols.  Bro.  Fred  Weaver 
was  sergeant  in  12th  Pa.  Vols.  Bro.  Fred  R.  Drake,  '86,  past  Phi 
Alpha,  organized  a  company  of  volunteers  and  was  elected  1st  lieutenant 
and  captain  for  the  war,  but  was  accepted  for  Pa.  National  Guard  only. 
This  company  contains  on  its  rolls  Bros.  Maurice  Clemens,  '88,  Past 
Sigma  Rho  Alpha,  now  lieutenant,  and  Bro.  Wm.  M.  Michler,  '93,  cor- 
poral. Bro.  Geo.  Watson  served  with  1st  N.  Y.  Engineers. 

During  1865  the  meetings  were  held  in  rooms  44  and  45  of  what  is  now 
known  as  South  College.  Up  to  the  year  1870,  the  existence  of  the  chapter 
was  maintained  in  great  secrecy.  In  fact,  until  this  time  all  fraternities 
at  Lafayette  were  kept  in  secrecy,  but  a  change  of  opinion  regarding 
them  soon  brought  about  a  different  condition  of  affairs.  The  fraternities, 
becoming  bolder,  instead  of  maintaining  secrecy,  endeavored  to  publish 
their  existence  far  and  wide.  In  this  movement  the  Tau  was  among  the 
first,  Bro.  O.  F.  Harvey,  '71,  being  the  first  man  at  Lafayette  to  wear  a 
fraternity  badge.  On  Feb.  16,  1870,  was  taken  the  first  picture  of  the 
active  chapter,  which  is  still  in  its  possession.  In  the  year  1871  the 


TAU  CHAPTER  459 

members  of  the  Tau  formed  themselves  into  a  boat  club  and  for  abouMen 
years  maintained  one  of  the  only  two  boat  crews  at  Lafayette.  In  1872-3 
the  headquarters  were  three  rooms  on  the  third  floor,  on  the  southwest 
corner  of  Northampton  Street  and  Center  Square.  In  October,  1874, 
another  change  was  made  to  three  rooms  in  the  Hay  Building.  The  number 
of  men,  however,  increased  to  such  proportions  that  in  a  short  time  the  whole 
house  was  rented.  The  number  in  the  chapter  at  this  time  was  twenty, 
the  largest  membership  it  has  ever  had.  The  experience  of  the  chapter 
with  the  chapter  house  at  that  time  was  such  as  to  make  the  Tau  feel 
that  at  Lafayette  at  least,  our  work  could  be  more  successfully  conducted 
if  the  men  roomed  in  the  dormitories  along  with  the  great  body  of 
students  and  had  simply  a  chapter  hall  and  meeting-rooms  downtown. 
The  sentiment  is  now  drifting  again  to  the  chapter  house  idea,  induced, 
no  doubt,  by  the  great  success  of  the  majority  of  our  fraternity  homes, 
and  a  permanent  chapter  house  fund,  though  small,  is  existent. 

In  January,  1883,  the  chapter  again  moved  its  quarters,  this  time  to 
the  third  floor  of  the  Drake  Building,  which  are  still  retained  and  where, 
in  connection  with  the  Red  Men's  lodge  room  on  the  same  floor,  two  Grand 
Chapter  meetings  with  the  Tau  have  been  held — the  first  on  Jan.  5th  and 
6th,  1886,  the  last  on  March  llth  and  12th,  1898.  On  December  31st,  1873, 
and  Jan.  1st,  1874,  the  first  convention  in  Easton  was  held  with  the  Tau, 
so  that  our  records  show  three  conventions  to  have  honored  us  with  their 
meetings.  Lafayette  Zetes  have  always  been  intensely  enthusiastic  and 
while  the  chapter  has  never  numbered  more  than  twenty,  and  generally 
averages  from  twelve  to  fifteen,  this  very  fact  seems  to  imbue  each 
Brother  the  more  with  the  spirit  of  Tau  Kappa  Phi  and  to  make  the  fra- 
ternity life  the  most  enjoyable  and  profitable  of  all  college  experiences. 
No  better  evidence  of  this  fact  need  be  given  than  the  number  of  Patri- 
archs in  the  chapter  when  the  small  chapter  roll  is  considered.  In  the 
order  of  classes,  the  following  have  served  the  Grand  Chapter:  Bros. 
Chas.  S.  McCormick,  '58,  Alpha  Sigma  Alpha;  Howard  R.  Hetrick,  '61, 
Alpha  Phi  Alpha;  Wm.  S.  Kirkpatrick,  '63,  Sigma  Alpha;  Wm.  Hackett, 
'64,  Sigma  Alpha;  Abraham  A.  Smith,  '68,  Sigma  Alpha;  John  Meigs, 
'71,  Phi  Alpha;  Thomas  A.  H.  Hay,  '76,  Alpha  Phi  Alpha;  John  Burke 
Hendry,  '76,  Sigma  rho  Alpha;  Edward  J.  Fox,  Jr.,  '78,  Sigma  Alpha; 
Henry'D.  Maxwell,  '82,  Sigma  rho  Alpha;  Fred  R.  Drake,  '86,  Alpha 
Sigma  Alpha,  Phi  Alpha;  John  Eyerman,  '88,  Alpha  Sigma  Alpha; 
Maurice  Clemens,  '88,  Sigma  rho  Alpha.  As  Phi  Alpha,  Bro.  Drake 
enjoys  the  distinction  of  having  paid  an  official  visit  to  every  chapter  in 
the  fraternity  excepting  the  two  on  the  Pacific  Coast. 

In  scholarship  during  its  43  years  of  uninterrupted  existence,  the 
chapter  has  always  maintained  an  enviable  record  and  has  had  valedic- 
torians and  Latin  salutatorians  as  well  as  numbers  of  representatives 
on  the  junior  oratorical  contests  which  are  held  by  the  two  rival 
Literary  Societies,  Washington  and  Franklin.  These  societies,  as  well 
as  the  Brainerd  Young  Men's  Christian  Association,  number  many  Zetes 
among  their  members.  The  Tau  has  graduated  eighteen  ministers  of  the 
Gospel,  mostly  into  the  Presbyterian  Church,  and  has  furnished  many 
to  the  law  and  the  faculty. 

Prof.  Wm.  Baxter  Owen,  '71,  was  valedictorian  of  his  class  and  is 
now  professor  of  the  Latin  Language  and  Literature.  A  deep  student 
of  Anglo-Saxon,  he  is  regarded  to-day  as  the  worthy  pupil  of  the  great 
Philologist  and  master  of  Anglo-Saxon,  Dr.  Francis  A.  March,  D.  C.  L., 
who  is  senior  professor  here  and  was  given  his  degree  at  Oxford, 
along  with  Hon.  Joseph  Chamberlain  and  Hon.  Thomas  F.  Bayard,  late 
Secretary  of  State  for  the  United  States  and  at  that  time  Ambassador  to 
England.  Dr.  John  Meigs,  '71,  was  professor  of  Modern  Languages 
here  until  1876,  and  is  now  head  master  and  owner  of  the  Hill  School, 
at  Pottstown,  Pa.,  one  of  the  largest  and  most  successful  preparatory 
schools  in  the  country.  Prof.  J.  Madison  Porter,  C.  E.,  '86,  has  had 
charge  of  the  department  of  civil  engineering  since  1890,  and  is  the 


460  TAU  CHAPTER 

grandson  of  Hon.  James  Madison  Porter,  who  was  Secretary  of  War  under 
President  Tyler  and  one  of  the  founders  and  president  of  the  board  of 
trustees  of  the  college  for  25  years,  the  treasurer  of  the  first  board,  Col. 
Thomas  McKeen,  having  been  his  great-uncle. 

The  chapter  numbers  among  its  distinguished  sons,  Hon.  A.  D. 
Hazen,  for  three  terms  3d  Ass't  Postmaster-General  of  U.  S. ;  Hon.  Wm. 
S.  Kirkpatrick,  member  of  board  of  trustees,  ex- Judge  of  the  Court  of 
Common  Pleas  of  Northampton  County,  ex- Attorney-General  of  Pennsyl- 
vania and  ex-Congressman  of  this  district,  having  been  the  only  Repub- 
lican elected  from  this  district  since  the  formation  of  the  Government; 
Gen.  Frank  Reeder,  ex-Secretary  of  the  Commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania. 
Hon.  Howard  J.  Reeder,  on  whose  death  resolutions  were  passed  at  our 
late  convention  at  Montreal,  was  for  two  terms  a  judge  of  the  courts  here 
and  a  judge  of  the  Superior  Court  of  Pennsylvania  at  the  time  of  his 
death.  Sons  of  both  these  distinguished  Brothers,  as  well  as  nephews, 
are  members  of  the  Tau.  Dr.  A.  A.  Smith,  '68,  past  Sigma  Alpha,  is 
professor  in  New  York  University  Medical  College  and  one  of  the  best- 
known  and  most  successful  practitioners  in  New  York  City.  Bro.  Wm. 
McMurtrie,  '71,  ex-chief  chemist  U.  S.  Agricultural  Department  and  U. 
S.  Commissioner  at  Paris  exposition,  1878.  Dr.  J.  Clifton  Edgar,  '82,  a 
prominent  physician,  is  professor  in  the  Medical  School  of  Cornell  Uni- 
versity, New  York  City.  Bro.  E.  J.  Fox,  Jr.,  '78,  past  Sigma  Alpha,  is 
a  member  of  the  board  of  trustees  of  the  college  and  one  of  the  most 
brilliant  members  of  the  Northampton  County  bar.  Bro.  Russell  C. 
Stewart,  '78,  was  prominently  mentioned  as  a  candidate  for  appoint- 
ment as  U.  S.  Circuit  Judge,  and  early  in  his  career  served  as  the  only 
district  attorney  of  his  political  faith  in  Northampton  County. 

Tau's  rolls  contain  the  names  of  many  distinguished  men  whom  it 
would  be  our  delight  to  mention  as  it  is  our  privilege  to  honor  them,  for 
whether  in  religion,  jurisprudence,  business  or  any  of  the  professions, 
the  men  of  Lafayette  have  always  taken  high  place  in  life's  varied 
work.  All  this  accentuates  the  role  the  Tau  was  bound  to  play  in  the 
social  life  of  the  college  town,  and  with  a  membership  recruited  con- 
stantly from  the  best  families  of  Easton,  the  Tau  has  stood  unrivaled 
among  the  other  fraternities  at  Lafayette  by  reason  of  the  interest  the 
town  Alumni  have  always  taken  in  the  welfare  of  the  chapter.  With 
over  forty  Easton  Zetes,  the  chapter  has  always  maintained  a  healthy 
existence,  though  at  one  time  the  active  membership  was  reduced  to  only 
four,  but  where  any  chapter  has  for  one  of  its  requirements  the  well- 
established  rule  that  no  matter  how  strong  a  man  may  be  in  religion, 
athletics  or  social  standing  he  must  first  be  a  gentleman,  "the  chap- 
ter can  be  counted  upon  to  take  deep  root  and  live  as  has  the  Tau 
through  43  changing  years.

HISTORY  OF  THE  UPSILON  CHAPTER 

The  foundation  of  the  Upsilon  is  thus  described  by  Mr.  M.  H.  Pin- 
nix,  in  a  letter  from  Lexington,  N.  C.,  dated  Dec.  28,  1889: 

"  The  Upsilon  Chapter  of  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity  was  established 
at  the  University  of  North  Carolina  in  the  year  1857.  The  charter  was 
obtained  through  the  Delta  Chapter  at  Rutgers  College,  New  Brunswick, 
N.  J.  R.  C.  Swain,  only  son  of  Governor  D.  L.  Swain,  President  of 
the  University,  opened  a  correspondence  with  Henry  W.  Bookstaver,  of 
the  Delta  Chapter,  in  reference  to  securing  a  chapter  at  the  University 
of  North  Carolina.  This  application  being  favorably  received,  the 
founders  of  the  Upsilon  Chapter,  consisting  of  J.  G.  McNab,  William 
Adams,  R.  F.  Kolb,  R.  C.  Swain,  W.  J.  Jones,  T.  C.  Evans  and  M.  H. 
Pinnix,  authorized  J.  G.  McNab  to  visit  the  Delta  Chapter  at  New 
Brunswick  and  to  secure  a  chapter  for  the  University  of  North  Carolina. 
He  went,  was  initiated  there  and  returned  with  the  charter,  clothed 
with  full  powers  to  organize  a  chapter  at  Chapel  Hill. 

"  The  first  meeting  was  held  in  the  room  occupied  by  R.  C.  Swain 
in  Governor  Swain's  yard  lawn.  There  the  above-named  persons  were 
initiated  as  members,  officers  were  elected  and  the  club  fully  organized. 
J.  G.  McNab  was  elected  <P,  which  position  was  afterwards  held  by 
M.  H.  Pinnix.  The  club  met  at  the  rooms  of  members  until  a  private 
room  was  rented  from  P.  H.  McDade,  on  Main  St.,  but  afterward 
rented  a  room  from  a  man  by  the  name  of  Yates,  on  the  corner  of  Main 
St.  and  the  street  running  parallel  with  the  western  border  of  the 
campus.  This  room  was  used  by  the  club  until  I  was  graduated  in 
June,  1859. 

"  Governor  Swain,  known  as  '  Old  Bunk, '  and  universally  beloved  by 
the  students,  was  much  interested  in  our  club,  which  was  no  doubt  due 
to  his  son's  (R.  C.  Swain)  connection  with  it. 

"  When  the  members  met  around  the  festive  board  with  James  C. 
and  John  H.  Dobbin,  Henry  (Harry)  K.  Burgwyn,  Charles  M.  Sted- 
man  (now  ex-Lieut. -Gov.  Stedman),  John  Bradford,  James  E.  Butts, 
Wilbur  Fiske  Foster,  E.  D.  Scales,  W.  E.  Holt  and  others  who  after- 
ward joined  the  club,  one  can  well  imagine  the  inexpressible  pleasure 
enjoyed  on  such  auspicious  occasions." 

The  date  1857,  given  by  Mr.  Pinnix  as  the  year  of  the  chapter's 
foundation,  must  mean  the  college  year  1857-8,  for  in  a  letter  from  R.  F. 
Kolb  to  the  Zeta  Chapter,  dated  Nov.  22,  1858,  it  is  said:  "We  were 
established  last  January,  and  had  to  contend  against  rather  embarrass- 
ing circumstances,  for  there  were  in  our  University  eight  or  ten  other 
secret  societies.  Some  of  these  societies  were  of  the  highest  standing, 
and,  of  course,  we  could  not  immediately  take  rank  among  the  first.  We 
commenced,  however,  at  the  beginning  to  initiate  none  save  those  who 
would  give  honor  and  dignity  to  our  fraternity." 

At  this  time  the  University  was  in  a  most  prosperous  condition.  In 
attendance,  in  income,  and  in  the  quality  of  its  work  it  stood  among  the 
first  of  the  old-time  colleges.  Club  after  club  was  established  till  even 
to  keep  pace  with  their  names  was  a  matter  of  difficulty.  Among  them 
all  it  is  certain  that  the  Upsilon  stood  well.  Were  no  other  proof  forth- 
coming the  success  achieved  by  its  members  in  after  life  would  be  a 
sufficient  witness.  All  through  the  years  1858-61  the  chapter's  pros- 
perity continued.  With  large  membership  and  high  intellectual  and 
social  standards  Zeta  Psi  had  risen  to  the  height  of  fraternity  glory 
when  news  of  the  secession  came. 

"Being  a  Southern  institution  the  sons  of  the  University  rushed 
into  the  war  with  all  the  elan  of  Southern  character,  trustees,  alumni, 
professors,  tutors  and  students  ceased  reading  of  the  old  wars  of  Greece 


496  UPSILON  CHAPTER 

and  Rome,  ceased  disputing-  about  the  conflicts  of  chemical  atoms, 
ceased  pondering  over  the  solution  of  mathematical  problems,  threw 
aside  their  books  and  their  studies,  gave  up  fair  hopes  and  scholarly 
leisure  and  life  itself,  without  grudging  the  magnitude  of  the  sacrifice. 
Into  that  great  vortex  were  plunged  the  largest  portion  of  our  wealth 
and  much  of  the  best  youth  of  our  country;  but  none  who  died  left  a 
wider  remembrance  or  more  sincere  mourners  than  the  sons  of  the  Uni- 
versity, the  victims  of  the  great  civil  war. 

"  The  University  was  one  of  the  few  institutions  which  kept  its  light 
burning  throughout  that  dark  and  bitter  period.  The  perseverance  of 
President  Swain  and  the  elder  of  his  coadjutors  (his  younger  associates 
had  gone  to  the  war)  kept  that  light  in  steady  radiance  until  Kilpat- 
rick's  cavalry  tramped  through  the  streets  of  Chapel  Hill. 

"  The  terrible  blow  to  higher  education  by  the  disastrous  struggle 
may  be  understood  from  the  simple  facts  that  out  of  the  95  Freshmen  who 
matriculated  in  1857-8  only  10,  out  of  the  10  Freshmen  of  1858-9  only  1, 
and  out  of  the  68  Freshmen  of  1859-60  only  5,  remained  to  receive  their 
diplomas  at  graduation.  Taking  the  three  classes  together  227  out  of 
243  lost  their  opportunity  of  higher  education,  nearly  allof  them  enlist- 
ing in  the  army.  The  tablets  in  the  Memorial  Hall  contain  260  names 
of  our  alumni  who  lost  their  lives  in  the  Confederate  cause,  beginning 
with  Lieuten ant-General  Bishop  Polk,  who  matriculated  in  1821,  and 
ending  with  Wm.  H.  G.  Webb,  of  1864.  "*  The  total  number  is  now 
known  to  be  at  least  312,  more  than  one  in  nine  of  all  matriculates  since 
1824. 

In  love  of  country  Zeta  Psi  stood  not  behind  the  rest.  The  vast  ma- 
jority of  her  members  hastened  to  ^he  front,  and  nine,  perhaps  ten,  lost 
their  lives  in  behalf  of  the  South.  The  bravery  of  the  Southern  Zetes 
was  conspicuous  on  many  a  battlefield. 

These  Brothers  were  engaged  in  the  Confederate  service:  C.  W. 
Broadfoot,  J.  W.  Hinsdale,  D.  Settle,  col's;  W.  H.  Johnston,  lieut.-

De  W.  Stevenson,  priv's,  in  addition  to  the  Zetes  who  were  killed  in 
service  or  who  died  from  the  effects  of  it :  R.  B.  Peebles,  adjt.-gen. ;  H.  K. 
Burgwyn,  col.;  J.  E.  Butts,  S.  D.  Richmond,  lieut's;  W.  Adams,  J.  M. 
Sutton,  capt's;  J.  N.  Thompson,  orderly;  J.  Bradford,  J.  H.  Dobbin, 
J.  G.  McNab,  priv's. 

During  the  war,  of  course,  correspondence  was  stopped  entirely. 
The  Upsilon  was  absolutely  alone  for  four  years,  but  it  was  not  long 
after  hostilities  ceased  until  there  was  a  reunion  of  Northern  and  South- 
ern Zetes,  the  old  relations  were  fully  restored  and  correspondence  was 
resumed. 

The  following  extracts  from  chapter  correspondence  are  of  interest: 

CHAPEL  HILL,  N.  C.,  Nov.  25, 1865. 
THE  UPSILON  TO  THE  GRAND  CHAPTER  SENDS  GREETING: 

Whereas,  for  the  last  four  years  the  Upsilon  Chapter  has  not  been 
represented  in  any  of  the  meetings  of  the  Grand  Chapter,  she  regrets  it 
much  and  begs  leave  to  submit  the  following  report: 


*  K.  P.  Battle,  The  University  of  North  Carolina,  1889,  pp.  48-49. 


UPSILON  CHAPTER  497 

That  owing1  to  the  distracted  and  severed  condition  of  the  country  cur- 
ing the  above  period,  all  communications  have  necessarily  been  much  re- 
stricted between  the  two  sections,  and  now  that  war,  with  its  attendant 
sufferings,  is  over,  the  chapter  has  addressed  letters  to  all  her  sister 
chapters,  in  conformity  with  the  constitution,  and  that  brotherly  relation 
has  again  been  resumed  much  to  her  gratification. 

The  Upsilon  also  begs  leave  to  state  to  the  Grand  Chapter  that,  not- 
withstanding almost  all  similar  institutions  in  the  South  had  been  dis- 
continued during  the  war,  and  but  few  colleges  were  able  to  perform 
their  functions,  she  has  weathered  the  storm  and  has  never  been  forced 
to  suspend  operations,  and  now  as  ever  she  stands  among  the  first,  and  I 
might  safely  say  as  the  first  of  the  secret  societies  of  this  university. 

T.  C.  DE  ROSSET. 

CHAPEL  HILL,  N.  C.,  May  7,  1866. 
The  T  to  the  H: 

*  *  *  Through  the  four  long  and  bloody  years  which  have 
lately  passed,  you  cannot  conceive  of  the  difficulties  and  dangers  our 
good  chapter  has  had  to  contend  with  and  battle  against.  Imagine 
a  university  with  the  quondam  number  of  400  and  500  students  reduced 
to  only  15,  with  but  two  of  that  number  to  steer  our  chapter  o'er  the  bil- 
lows and  to  emerge  with  it  or  without  it.  These  two  heroes  are  Bros. 
Geo.  Slover  and  J.  S.  Carr,  to  whom  the  temptation  to  desert  our  ship  of 
state  and  let  the  T  sink  into  utter  oblivion  was  by  no  means  weak.  But 
proud  are  we  that  in  safety  and  triumph  did  they  bear  it  through,  and 
now  we  stand  at  the  pathway  of  life  fully  determined  never  to  lag,  but  to 
be  among  the  first  and  foremost. 

T.  C.  DE  ROSSET,  A  2  of  T. 

The  first  Grand  Chapter  meeting  after  the  war  was  held  in  New 
York  on  Wednesday,  December  25,  1865.  In  a  report  of  its  proceedings 
the  Times  says: 

"  The  meeting  was  well  attended  by  delegates  from  all  parts  of  the 
country,  North  and  South.  Among  the  latter  were  Col.  J.  W.  Hinsdale, 
Major  W.  T.  Ennett  and  Capt.  W.  H.  Johnston,  who  had  served  for  four 
years  in  the  Confederate  Army.  The  Southern  members  were  received 
most  cordially  b\'  their  Northern  brethren,  and  the  friendliest  feeling 
prevailed  throughout." 

An  extract  from  the  minutes  of  the  convention  reads:  "  Bro.  Hinsdale 
appeared  for  the  Upsilon,  which  had  been  necessarily  unrepresented  since 
the  commencement  of  the  war,  and  said  that  the  organization  had  been 
preserved  during  the  war  and  now  stood  on  firm  ground.  He  was  wel- 
comed with  enthusiastic  applause." 

From  1865  the  Upsilon  steadily  increased  in  numbers  and  in  in- 
fluence. 

Trouble  of  a  serious  character  was  however  at  hand.  The  conduct 
of  R.  C.  Swain,  one  of  the  founders  of  the  chapter,  caused  great  annoy- 
ance, and  at  length,  in  the  spring  of  1867,  expulsion  was  necessar y.  The 
session  of  1867-8  opened  most  prosperously  for  the  Upsilon.  The  full 
quota  of  members  was  obtained.  On  August  26  the  annual  club  supper 
was  held,  and  W.  H.  S.  Burgwyn  delivered  the  oration. 

Never  was  the  chapter  more  flourishing  than  when  the  end  came. 
In  the  course  of  reconstruction  measures  in  North  Carolina  the  old  faculty 
and  trustees  were  removed,  and  new  appointments  made  in  harmony  with 
the  views  of  the  dominant  political  party.  In  view  of  the  possibility  of 
this  change,  at  the  last  meeting  of  the  old  Upsilon,  on  May  30,  1868,  the 
following  motion  was  adopted :  "That  a  committee  of  three  be  appointed 
with  carte  blanche  powers  to  act  on  behalf  of  the  fraternity  in  case 
the  University  suspends  its  operations  during  the  ensuing  year,  and 
with  instructions  to  take  care  of  the  furniture,  apparatus,  etc."  Messrs. 
Carr,  A.  W.  Graham  and  Fetter  were  appointed. 


498  UPSILON   CHAPTER 

As  was  expected,  the  old  patronage  of  the  University  was  withdrawn 
on  the  removal  of  the  old  officers.  Many  of  the  members  of  the  Upsilon 
went  to  the  University  of  Virginia,  and  a  new  chapter  was  formed  there 
in  the  following  autumn  and  named  the  Beta.  The  committee,  composed 
of  Messrs.  Carr,  Graham  and  Fetter,  discharged  their  duties.  Most  of 
the  furniture  was  sold,  but  some  is  now  in  use  by  the  new  Upsilon. 
Especially  does  the  new  chapter  prize  the  old  Bible  and  Constitution 
which  were  used  by  the  Beta  till  its  suspension  in  1882,  and  in  1885  re- 
turned to  the  Upsilon.  It  should  be  said  also  that  when  the  Upsilon  was 
reestablished  a  considerable  sum  of  money  was  handed  over  by  Mr. 
Graham,  chairman  of  the  committee,  as  the  proceeds  of  the  sale  of  old 
chapter  furniture.  Owing  to  lack  of  students  and  the  absence  of  legis- 
lative support  the  University,  after  a  year's  suspension,  could  remain 
open  only  two  sessions.  From  1871  to  1875  the  University  halls  were 
tenantless.  In  1875  a  large  sum  was  raised  for  repairs  to  the  buildings, 
the  General  Assembly  induced  to  vote  to  the  University  the  proceeds, 
amounting  to  $7,500  yearly,  of  the  national  land  grant  of  1862  in  aid  of 
agricultural  and  mechanical  colleges,  and  the  University  was  reopened. 
A  new  era  in  its  history  had  begun. 

During  the  years  1875-85  fraternities  were  frowned  upon  by  the  au- 
thorities of  the  University.  One  existed,  sub  rosa,  almost  from  the 
beginning,  and  there  were  two  others  instituted  later,  but  that  these 
were  in  operation  did  not  become  generally  known  until  the  fall  of  1884. 
Feeling  then  became  so  bitter  against  them  that  the  whole  University  was 
divided  into  Fraternity  and  Anti-Fraternity  parties.  The  existence  of 
secret  clubs  being  now  known,  the  trustees  were  forced  to  take  action  in 
regard  to  them,  either  to  repress  with  a  vigorous  hand  or  to  recognize, 
and  so  control.  In  the  debate  on  this  question  several  Zetes,  members 
of  the  old  Upsilon  and  the  Beta,  took  a  prominent  part,  and  their  argu- 
ments carried  the  day.  The  same  year  that  marked  the  trebling  of  the 
legislative  appropriation  saw  also  the  reestablishment  of  the  fraternity 
system. 

The  decision  of  the  trustees  being  announced,  several  new  societies 
were  at  once  projected,  the  evidence  of  which  was  shown  in  the  frequent 
whispered  conferences  between  bodies  of  students  in  some  quiet  corner. 
It  was  in  February,  1885,  that  by  agreement  the  following  four  students — 
Weill,  Monroe,  Grandy,  L.,  and  Jackson — met  in  the  room  of  the  last- 
named,  and  after  drawing  the  curtains,  bolting  the  door  and  plugging 
the  keyhole,  proceeded  to  discuss  informally  the  propriety  of  organizing 
a  fraternity.  It  was  decided  to  form  a  local  fraternity,  which  was 
named  P  2  T.  Scon  N.  H.  D.  Wilson,  Jr.,  and  C.  T.  Grandy  were 
added  to  the  little  coterie. 

At  this  juncture  it  was  learned  that  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity  might  be 
willing  to  reestablish  its  old  chapter  here.  Mr.  Weill  proceeded  to 
Raleigh  to  interview  Lieutenant-Governor  Stedman,  a  prominent 
alumnus  of  the  University  and  an  enthusiastic  Zete.  Here  he  met  a 
young  man,  W.  W.  Fuller,  of  Durham,  N.  C.,  now  of  New  York,  a  most 
successful  lawyer,  who  may  justly  be  called  the  father  of  the  new  Upsi- 
lon. Mr.  Fuller  enlisted  in  his  work  two  other  enthusiastic  menibers  of 
the  fraternity  in  Durham— Messrs.  J.  S.  Carr  and  Eugene  Morehead — 
and  through  them  a  petition  was  at  once  made  to  the  Grand  Chapter. 

In  order  to  give  the  infant  organization  a  more  dignified  status  and 
to  enable  it  the  better  to  tide  over  the  period  of  waiting  till  the  petition 
to  the  Grand  Chapter  should  be  accepted,  Mr.  Fuller  proposed  a  formal 
inauguration  of  the  new  local  fraternity,  and  appointed  the  night  of 
March  12  for  the  purpose.  In  the  meantime  two  new  recruits  had  been 
added — Hayne  Davis  and  William  James  Battle. 

Having  entire  confidence  in  the  success  of  the  cause,  a  hall  had  been 
engaged  and  supplied  with  chairs  and  a  table,  the  former  having  been 
transported  under  cover  of  night  from  the  recitation-room  of  President 
Battle.  Mr.  Fuller  and  Mr.  Morehead  were  the  guests  of  the  occasion. 


UPSILON  CHAPTER  499 

After  a  preliminary  discussion  of  the  matter  in  the  room  of  Wilson  and 
Grandy,  L,.,  the  company  made  its  way,  a  solemn  procession,  through 
snow  and  sleet  and  rain,  to  the  little  office  in  the  yard  of  Mr.  J.  W.  Carr, 
a  mystic  temple  long-  ago  outgrown,  but  ever  dear  to  these  first  initiates. 
The  ceremonies  of  inauguration  were  simple  in  the  extreme,  and  the 
wretched  fires  did  not  add  to  their  attractiveness,  so  it  was  not  long 
before  adjournment  was  made  to  more  comfortable  quarters.  There  cold 
was  soon  forgotten  in  the  delights  of  a  most  sumptuous  feast.  After  the 
excitements  of  this  night  the  delay  of  Zeta  Psi  in  acting  on  the  petition 
to  revive  the  Upsilon  was  a  sore  trial,  but  none  the  less  did  the  would-be 
chapter  proceed.  Before  long  a  new  member,  W.  S.  Wilkinson,  being 
added  to  the  fold,  the  mystic  nine  was  completed,  and  the  furnishing  of 
the  hall  was  entered  upon  with  much  enthusiasm.  And  so  the  term 
ended. 

At  the  opening  of  the  next  session  of  1885-6  Messrs.  E.  P.  Mangum, 
W.  M.  Gulick  and  C.  W.  Toms  were  duly  elected  and  initiated  with 
all  the  pomp  and  dignity  that  could  be  improvised  for  the  occasion. 
In  January,  1886,  L.  D.  Howell  became  the  thirteenth  member  of  the 
order.  In  December  came  the  glad  news  that  the  much-discussed 
petition  had  at  last  been  granted  and  that  the  Upsilon  might  now  be 
reestablished. 

A  committee  of  alumni  was  appointed  to  carry  out  the  work,  and  on 
December  11, 1885,  the  reorganization  was  accomplished  by  Messrs.  Fuller 
and  Carr,  the  only  members  of  the  committee  who  could  attend.  The 
system  of  correspondence  then  entered  on  proved  a  strong  bond  of  union 
with  the  other  chapters  and  an  incentive  to  strive  always  after  the  Fra- 
ternity's high  ideal.  To  men  so  far  away  from  the  main  body  of  Zetes 
these  chapter  letters  are  of  more  value  and  interest  than  many  are  apt 
to  think.  The  session  of  1886-7  was  one  of  quiet  prosperity.  The  rees- 
tablishment  of  the  chapter  was  commemorated  by  the  placing  in  its  hall 
of  a  handsome  shield  blazoned  with  the  fraternity  escutcheon.  Then, 
too,  was  inaugurated  a  pleasant  custom  of  celebrating  the  anniversary, 
not  only  with  a  banquet,  but  with  appropriate  literary  exercises. 

The  next  year  was  marked  by  the  taking  of  steps  to  build  a  chapter 
house.  A  beautiful  site  was  secured  fronting  the  University  campus, 
and  after  much  hard  work  the  little  house  was  finished  in  the  spring 
of  1889.  Of  the  active  members  most  prominent  in  the  movement  were 
Battle  and  Rosenthal.  Among  the  old  Zetes  many  helped,  but  it  was 
again  those  of  Durham  who  showed  most  interest.  "Durham,"  wrote 
Mr.  Fuller,  "will  see  you  through."  A  tiny  cottage  it  is,  but  in  good 
taste  and  neatly  furnished — a  simple  home,  not  inappropriate  to  the 
simple  life  of  the  early  years  of  the  new  Upsilon. 

Up  to  the  year  1893  the  chapter  continued  small,  the  membership 
scarcely  exceeding  twelve.  This  fact,  however,  served  to  bind  the 
Brothers  together  more  closely  and  enabled  them  more  thoroughly  to 
work  out  and  to  establish  the  guiding  principles  of  their  chapter  life.  The 
chapter  became  noted  for  the  strength  of  its  fraternity  feeling,  yet  with- 
out unworthy  exclusiveness;  and  for  the  loftiness  of  its  standards  of 
character  and  attainment  without  conceit,  a  reputation  which  it  still 
bears  and,  let  us  hope,  always  will. 

With  the  session  of  1893-4  the  chapter  entered  upon  a  new  phase  of 
its  life.  Its  numbers  rose  to  eighteen  and  have  since  continued  near 
this  figure.  But  this  increase  implies  no  deterioration  of  standard;  the 
growth  of  the  University  offers  more  than  twice  as  many  men  to  select 
from  as  it  did  in  1889.  The  new  conditions  soon  made  it  clear  that  a 
new  chapter  house  would  be  beneficial.  Other  fraternities  were  build- 
ing, and  the  social  entertainments  which  now  became  more  frequent 
made  larger  and  more  elegant  rooms  a  necessity.  The  funds  for  this 
purpose  have  been  gradually  raised  and  the  erection  of  the  house  is  about 
to  begin.  It  is  to  be  in  the  Colonial  style,  with  rooms  of  generous  size 
and  bids  fair  to  satisfy  all  the  chapter's  needs  and  to  be  also  the  most

attractive  fraternity  hall  at  Chapel  Hill.     The  conditions  of  student  life 
there  do  not  render  a  lodge  desirable. 

In  the  new  Upsilon,  as  in  the  old,  there  have  been  times  of  discour- 
agement, but  on  the  whole  its  career  has  been  one  of  distinct  prosperity. 
Its  members  have  won  their  share  of  college  honors,  intellectual,  social 
and  athletic,  while  their  constant  maintenance  of  the  highest  ideals  of 
college  life  has  always  kept  the  chapter  in  the  front  rank  of  the  frater- 
nities at  the  University  of  North  Carolina.

HISTORY  OF  THE  XI  CHAPTER 

Zeta  Psi  was  established  at  the  University  of  Michigan  in  1858,  and 
has  had  a  continuous  existence  there  for  more  than  forty  years.  The 
Michigan  chapter  was  the  first  western  chapter  of  Zeta  Psi,  and  is  twelfth 
on  the  roll  of  the  Fraternity.  For  several  years  before  the  establish- 
ment of  the  chapter  of  Zeta  Psi  the  conditions  at  Michigan  had  been 
favorable  to  the  development  of  college  fraternities;  as  early  as  1855 
the  University  of  Michigan,  although  poorly  equipped  as  to  buildings, 
and  having  only  449  students,  was  yet  recognized  as  one  of  the  leading 
institutions  of  learning  in  the  country.  The  faculty  was  exceptionally 
strong,  including  men  of  national  reputation,  while  the  administrative 
policy,  which  has  since  made  Michigan  one  of  the  largest  and  most  im- 
portant universities  in  the  United  States,  was  even  then  shaping  itself. 
Several  of  the  leading  college  fraternities  had  already  established  chap- 
ters at  Michigan,  having  included  the  Western  institution  with  the 
oldest  and  best-known  Eastern  colleges  as  a  proper  field  in  which  to 
develop  the  society  system. 

Such  were  the  conditions  at  Michigan  when  Liberty  Emery  Holden 
entered  the  Junior  class  in  1856.  He  came  from  Waterville  College,  now 
Colby  College,  Waterville,  Maine,  where  he  was  a  member  of  the  Chi 
Chapter  of  Zeta  Psi.  The  same  fall  James  Franklin  Spalding  entered 
the  University  as  a  Freshman,  and  the  two  men  became  acquainted. 
From  this  association  resulted  the  establishment  of  Zeta  Psi  at  Mich- 
igan. 

About  May  20,  1858,  the  authority  for  the  establishment  of  a  chapter 
of  Zeta  Psi  at  the  University  of  Michigan,  together  with  the  ritual  and 
other  necessary  papers,  having  been  received  through  the  Chi  Chapter  at 
Waterville,  Me.,  Holden  at  once  called  a  meeting.  At  this  meeting  there 
were  also  present  Horace  Halbert,  Henry  Augustine  Humphrey  and  Lewis 
McLouth,  of  the  class  of  '58,  then  Seniors,  and  James  Franklin  Spald- 
ing, '60,  who  represented  the  Alpha  Psi,  a  local  society  which  had  been 
organized  as  a  nucleus  for  the  fraternity  chapter.  The  ritual  was  read 
and  explained  to  these  men,  and  they,  together  with  Liberty  Emery  Hol- 
den, then  became  the  founders  of  the  University  of  Michigan  Chapter  of 
Zeta  Psi,  which  was  named  the  Beta  Chapter.  This  meeting  was  held 
in  Lewis  McLouth's  room,  in  the  middle  of  a  block  on  Broadway,  near 
Wall  Street,  Lower  Town.  The  old  building,  which  was  the  birthplace 
of  Zeta  Psi  in  Ann  Arbor,  still  stands.  The  subsequent  meetings  of  the 
chapter  during  the  spring  of  1858  were  held  in  the  residence  of  James  F. 
Spalding's  father  on  Maynard  Street,  in  the  second  block  northwest  from 
the  University.  On  Commencement  Day,  June  23,  1858,  the  presence  of 
Zeta  Psi  in  Ann  Arbor  was  made  known  by  the  appearance  on  the  cam- 
pus of  fifteen  men  wearing  the  new  badge.  The  young  chapter  from  the 
first  commanded  the  respect  of  faculty  and  students.  This  was  due  some- 
what to  the  influence  of  the  general  fraternity,  but  more  particularly  to 
the  recognized  character  of  the  men  who  had  become  members,  eight  of 
them  being  students  for  the  ministry.  Of  these  first  members  of  Michi- 
gan Zeta  Psi  six  are  dead,  many  of  the  living  have  become  prominent — 
four  being  college  professors  and  two  ministers  of  the  gospel.  During 
the  summer  of  1858  a  committee,  of  which  Spalding  was  chairman,  fitted 
up  the  first  lodgeroom  of  the  chapter.  It  was  on  the  third  floor  of  a  block 
on  Main  Street,  between  Huron  and  Washington  Streets,  opposite  and 
north  of  Hangsterfer's  Hall. 

In  the  next  two  years  the  young  fraternity  grew  rapidly,  the  member- 
ship increasing  to  twenty-seven  in  1859-60,  including  some  of  the  best 
men  in  the  Freshman  class  of  each  of  these  years.  Unhappily  this 


528  XI  CHAPTER 

prosperity  was  interrupted.  In  the  fall  and  early  winter  of  1860-61 
there  arose  a  marked  difference  of  opinion  concerning  the  standard  for 
admission.  A  number  of  the  members,  who  were  deeply  religious,  began 
to  see  that  their  own  convictions  as  to  the  importance  of  this  special 
quality  as  a  prerequisite  for  membership  were  not  shared  by  a  consider  able 
number  of  those  in  active  membership.  The  feeling  finally  became  so 
strong  that  twelve  men,  just  half  the  membership,  resigned.  The  first 
meetings  after  this  crisis  were  gloomy,  but  several  of  the  remaining 
members  spoke  with  resolution,  and  all  pledged  anew  fealty  and  alle- 
giance to  Zeta  Psi.  This  little  band  stood  loyally  by  the  fraternity  and 
all  won  respect  from  professors  and  students  for  their  courage  and  perse- 
verance. They  reorganized  the  chapter  in  April,  1861,  as  the  Xi  of  Zeta 
Psi. 

The  young  chapter  had  no  sooner  passed  through  this  struggle  than 
it  faced  a  new  danger.  Upon  the  breaking  out  of  the  civil  war  seven  of 
the  members  of  the  chapter  enlisted.  Two  others  entered  the  army  as 
soon  as  they  were  old  enough.  This  was  only  the  third  year  of  the  chap- 
ter's existence,  yet  of  the  members  of  Zeta  Psi  already  graduated  five 
enlisted.  Of  the  subsequent  members  twelve  were  in  the  army  during 
the  whole  or  a  part  of  the  war.  The  total  representation  of  the  chapter 
in  the  different  armies  was  twenty-six.  Most  of  these  men  were  officers, 
the  list  including  one  brigadier-general  and  four  captains.  The  chapter 
had  one  man  in  the  Confederate  Army,  Richard  B.  Robinson,  a  Texan, 
who  was  a  private  in  Breckenridge's  "Orphan  Brigade."  Until  1864 
the  chapter  was  barely  kept  alive  by  the  efforts  of  James  F.  Spalding, 
'60,  Lewis  S.  Pilcher,  '62,  and  Homer  L.  Wright,  '64.  In  1865  the  mem- 
bership again  rose  to  twenty,  and  the  crisis  in  the  early  life  of  the  chap- 
ter was  passed. 

From  1865  to  1875,  the  life  of  the  chapter  was  uneven.  During  the 
first  five  years  the  members  were  active  in  college  affairs,  and  their 
scholarship  was  creditable.  From  1870  to  1874,  men  were  taken  from  the 
Law  Department,  and  many  of  the  members  from  the  Literary  Depart- 
ment remained  in  college  but  a  short  time.  The  membership  of  the 
chapter  accordingly  changed  rapidly  and  few  were  graduated.  The 
average  membership  was  fifteen.  In  1872  the  chapter  first  attempted 
clubrooms  in  connection  with  the  initiation  hall.  The  two  floors  over  32 
Huron  Street  were  rented.  Back  of  the  general  clubroom  were  two 
sleeping-rooms  occupied  by  members  of  the  chapter. 

From  1875  to  1880  the  Xi  was  particularly  active  in  college  life. 
Ben.  T.  Cable  was  president  of  the  Senior  class  in  '76,  and  was  prom- 
inent as  an  all-round  athlete,  holding  the  college  record  for  the  hun- 
dred-yard dash  throughout  his  course.  In  the  fall  of  1879  the  first 
game  of  Rugby  football,  in  which  Michigan  took  part,  was  played  in  De- 
troit with  the  University  of  Toronto  eleven,  about  half  of  the  men  on  each 
team  being  Zetes.  When  President  Angell  left  Ann  Arbor  as  United 
States  Minister  to  China,  Zeta  Psi  had  the  marshal  of  the  farewell 
parade  given  in  his  honor.  In  those  days  the  members  were  a  jolly  set 
of  fellows,  who  cared  little  for  society,  but  who  were  popular  in  college, 
because  they  were  manly,  honorable  men,  true  to  themselves,  to  Zeta 
Psi,  and  to  their  friends.  There  were  few  college  scrapes,  however, 
in  which  the  Zetes  did  not  have  a  part,  from  horning  professors  to  stand- 
ing trial  for  riot.  Toward  the  close  of  the  seventies  the  members  of  the 
chapter  occupied  houses  near  town  for  a  short  time.  About  Christmas, 

1879,  they  rented  the  Millen  property  on  Washtenaw  Avenue,  a  large  and 
imposing  brick  house,  with  extensive  and  beautiful  grounds.   In  January, 

1880,  sixteen  Zetes  moved  into  this  house,  which  was  then  the  best  frater- 
nity residence  in  Ann  Arbor.   It  was  here  that  the  boys  gave  a  dinner  for 
Remenyi,  President  Angell  also  being  a  guest  of  honor.      At  commence- 
ment time,  in  1880,  the  Zetes  gave  a  house  party  and  dance,  one  of  the 
features  of  which  was  the  illumination  of  the  grounds.      The  chapter 
lived  in  this  house  until  February  22d,  1883.     Early  in  the  winter  many 


XI  CHAPTER  529 

of  the  members  were  taken  sick,  and  Ralph  Keuchler,  '84,  died  in  the 
house,  which,  on  being  found  to  be  in  poor  sanitary  condition,  was  aban- 
doned. 

The  years  from  1880  to  1886  were  years  of  struggle.  After  commence- 
ment in  1883,  Harry  Forbes,  '84,  was  the  only  Zete  in  college.  To  him 
and  to  several  men  whom  he  secured,  the  chapter  owes  the  continuance 
of  its  existence  at  that  time.  The  membership  was  small  during  the 
entire  period,  varying  from  six  to  twelve.  They  were  a  congenial  crowd, 
however,  with  common  interests  and  social  instincts. 

In  June,  1886,  the  chapter  moved  to  the  Jacobs  house,  on  the  east  side 
of  Fourth  Street,  corner  of  Williams,  into  what  was  then  probably  the 
best-rented  house  in  Ann  Arbor.  Here  the  chapter  lived  for  four  years, 
until  June,  1890.  The  average  membership  was  about  thirteen.  In  1887, 
and  throughout  this  period,  the  members  took  an  active  part  in  college 
politics.  It  was  through  the  efforts  of  the  Zete  Seniors  of  '87  that  a 
fraternity  man  was  elected  president  of  that  class  in  opposition  to  the 
independent  vote.  The  fraternities  were  themselves  divided  into  two 
factions  on  the  basis  of  representation  on  the  editorial  boards  of  the 
weekly  papers,  the  Chronicle  and  the  Argonaut.  The  strife  between 
these  two  factions  was  sometimes  friendly,  sometimes  bitter.  Zeta  Psi 
controlled  the  management  of  the  Chronicle  in  1887,  1889  and  1890,  and 
was  recognized  as  the  most  active  fraternity  in  the  Chronicle  faction, 
which  consisted  of  seven  fraternities.  This  factional  division  disappeared 
with  the  consolidation  of  the  two  papers  into  the  Chronicle- Argonaut  in 
1891,  afterwards  changed  to  the  Yellow  and  Blue,  which  was  short-lived, 
having  ceased  publication  in  1893.  After  the  consolidation  Zeta  Psi  was 
continuously  represented  on  the  board  of  editors,  and  twice  held  the 
managing  editorship.  During  the  first  two  years  in  the  Jacobs  house 
Zeta  Psi  had  four  men  on  the  glee  and  banjo  clubs,  including  Clark,  the 
whistler,  who  made  the  Michigan  Glee  Club  famous  at  this  time.  The 
scholarship  of  the  chapter  at  this  time  was  particularly  strong,  almost 
all  of  the  members  being  graduated  with  credit  to  themselves  and  to  Zeta 
Psi.  Three  of  the  men  of  this  period  have  become  college  professors  and 
heads  of  departments. 

In  the  spring  of  1890  the  owner  of  the  house  gave  notice  that  he 
would  not  rent  it  for  another  term  of  years.  The  chapter  was  con- 
fronted with  the  serious  problem  of  finding  a  new  home.  The  need  of 
a  permanent  chapter  house,  owned  by  the  fraternity,  was  then  felt 
to  be  a  very  pressing  one.  The  city  was  thoroughly  canvassed  for  a 
desirable  location,  and  at  a  meeting  held  commencement  week  of  mem- 
bers representing  classes  from  1860  to  1893,  it  was  decided  to  purchase  a 
lot  at  once  and  to  build  a  chapter  house  as  soon  as  possible.  The  lot 
selected  was  known  as  the  Hunt  property,  and  is  admirably  situated  on 
State  Street,  directly  in  front  of  the  southwest  corner  of  the  University 
grounds,  having  a  frontage  of  82)4  feet,  with  a  depth  of  250  feet,  and 
is  valued  at  $8,000.  The  house  is  set  back  from  the  street  about  50  feet, 
as  are  all  the  houses  in  the  block,  with  three  rows  of  trees  between  the 
house  line  and  the  street.  This  property  was  secured  by  an  advance 
payment  made  by  "W.  K.  Anderson,  '68,  and  J.  M.  Brewer,  '80,  of  De- 
troit, and  is  now  owned  by  the  Zeta  Psi  Association  of  Michigan, 
which  was  duly  incorporated  under  Act  No.  22  of  the  Public  Acts  of 
the  State  of  Michigan  for  the  year  1883,  articles  of  incorporation  being 
filed  August  18,  1890.  The  first  officers  of  the  association,  elected 
September  3,  1890,  were — directors:  I.  M.  Weston,  '67,  president;  W.  K. 
Anderson,  '68,  vice-president;  Henry  H.  Swan,  '62,  Henry  T.  Thurber, 
'74,  and  Frank  H.  Culver,  '75;  Pomeroy  Ladue,  '90,  secretary;  J.  M. 
Brewer,  '80,  treasurer. 

In  the  fall  of  1890  the  chapter  went  to  live  in  the  old  frame  house 
which  stood  on  the  State  Street  property.  At  this  time  the  chapter  num- 
bered fourteen  men.  In  1891-2  the  membership  rose  to  twenty-one,  and 
in  the  fall  of  '93  the  largest  Freshman  class  taken  into  the  chapter  up  to 


530  XI  CHAPTER 

that  time  was  initiated,  consisting  of  eleven  men.  The  chapter  main- 
tained an  exceptionally  high  position  in  the  fraternity  ranks  of  Michigan, 
and  was  active  in  all  college  enterprises.  Zeta  Psi  held  numerous  editor- 
ships, and  was  also  well  represented  on  the  musical  clubs,  having  at  one 
time  five  men  on  the  two  clubs,  including  the  assistant  manager.  On  Feb- 
ruary 23, 1894,  the  active  members,  about  twenty  in  number,  went  to  Detroit 
to  attend  a  banquet  at  the  Russell  House,  under  the  auspices  of  the  Detroit 
Alumni;  some  sixty  or  more  Zetes  were  in  attendance.  Judge  Henry  H. 
Swan,  '62,  acted  as  toastmaster. 

The  last  five  years  of  the  Xi's  history  mark  a  stage  in  the  develop- 
ment of  the  chapter.  The  old  idea  that  a  college  fraternity  is  simply  a 
social  institution  for  the  enjoyment  of  its  members  has  given  place  to  the 
realization  that  the  fraternity  must  take  a  helpful  part  in  the  organized 
effort  of  college  life;  not  obtrusive,  but  through  the  influence  of  this 
higher  and  safer  ideal  upon  the  active  members,  urging  them  to  sus- 
tained effort  along  the  various  lines  of  college  endeavor.  One  result  of 
this  evolution  has  been  the  improved  scholarship  of  the  chapter.  While 
the  Xi  does  not  seek  high-standing  men  primarily,  it  is  an  established 
principle  of  the  chapter  to  demand  consistent  scholarship  from  its  mem- 
bers. 

To  the  active  members  and  to  the  little  band  of  faithful  alumni, 
which  has  been  the  mainstay  of  the  chapter  during  all  the  past  years, 
perhaps  the  most  gratifying  result  of  the  enlarged  scope  and  purpose  of 
the  chapter  life  is  the  increased  fraternal  relations  between  the  active 
chapter  and  the  alumni.  The  visits  of  the  alumni  to  their  Alma  Mater 
and  their  fraternity  home  have  become  frequent ;  the  banquets  in  Detroit 
are  well  attended,  as  are  the  commencement  reunions  in  Ann  Arbor. 
This  increased  interest  of  the  alumni  in  the  work  of  the  chapter  was 
greatly  assisted  by  the  publication  in  June,  1897,  of  the  Biographical 
Catalogue  of  the  Xi  Chapter  of  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity,  a  pamphlet 
of  eighty-one  pages.  The  interest  of  the  alumni  has  also  taken  practi- 
cal shape  in  their  cooperation  with  the  active  members  to  bring  the 
house  scheme  to  a  successful  issue.  In  '97-'98  the  outstanding  mortgages 
upon  the  fraternity  property  were  paid  off,  by  a  subscription  of  $2,500 
from  the  active  members.  This  was  accomplished  chiefly  through  the 
efforts  of  W.  A.  Comstock,  '99,  to  whose  energy,  liberality  and  judicious 
management  is  largely  due  the  success  of  this  final  effort  to  build  a  chap- 
ter house  in  keeping  with  the  position  of  Zeta  Psi  at  Michigan.  The 
necessary  sum  was  raised  during  the  following  year,  principally  through 
the  generous  and  loyal  cooperation  of  Ben.  T.  Cable,  '76,  and  Liberty 
E.  Holden,  '58.  In  April,  '99,  the  chapter  moved  out  of  the  old  frame 
house,  which  was  shortly  torn  down.  The  new  building  was  immedi- 
ately begun,  and  will  be  ready  for  use  in  the  spring  of  1900.  It  is  built 
of  Portage  Entry  red  sandstone,  backed  with  brick,  from  plans  furnished 
by  John  Eisenmann,  Xi  '71,  of  Cleveland,  Ohio.  The  interior  is  fin- 
ished in  hardwood.  Upon  the  ground  floor  are  reception-hall,  library, 
music-stand,  dining-room  and  a  large  suite  which  may  be  used  as  a  par- 
lor or  for  study-rooms.  The  second  and  third  floors  contain  rooms  for 
fifteen  men  and  the  servants.  The  house  also  contains  a  beautiful  chap- 
ter-hall. The  dining-room,  one  of  the  features  of  the  house,  is  32  x  20 
feet,  and  is  panelled  in  oak,  the  windows  being  of  stained  glass;  at  one 
end  is  a  commodious  fireplace. 

The  present  officers  of  the  Zeta  Psi  Association  of  Michigan,  under 
whose  administration  the  new  house  has  become  an  accomplished  fact, 
are:  Directors — Henry  H.  Swan,  '62,  President;  Pomeroy  Ladue,  '90, 
Vice-President;  Dwight  J.  Turner,  '98,  Secretary;  Austin  E.  Wing,  '77, 
Treasurer;  George  T.  Tremble,  '94,  and  James  Howard  Bement,  '96. 
The  House  Committee  of  the  chapter  is  composed  as  follows:  T.  L.  Robin- 
son, '00,  Chairman;  D.  W.  Mills,  '01;  J.  A.  Elliott,  '02. 

The  average  membership  from  1894  to  1899  was  twenty-three,  the 
highest  average  ever  reached  by  the  Xi.  The  largest  membership  of  this 


XI  CHAPTER 


531 


period  was  twenty-six  in  1898-9.  When  the  war  with  Spain  broke  out, 
eight  Xi  Zetes,  elders  and  active  members,  entered  the  army.  James 
E.  Eastman,  '62,  captain  of  artillery  in  the  regular  army,  died  on 
August  27,  1899,  of  fever  contracted  in  the  Cuban  campaign. 

This  history  would  not  be  complete  without  mention  of  the  part  which 
the  Xi  Chapter  has  taken  in  the  deliberations  and  proceedings  of  the 
Grand  Chapter  of  Zeta  Psi.  Since  its  establishment  in  1858,  the  chapter 
has  been  represented  in  all  but  six  of  the  Grand  Chapter  meetings. 
Twice  has  the  chapter  held  the  highest  office  in  the  fraternity.  John 
L.  Lambert,  '65,  presided  over  the  twenty-first  annual  session  of  the 
Grand  Chapter  in  New  York  on  December  27,  1867.  Liberty  E.  Hoi- 
den  was  elected  #  A  in  1884,  and  presided  over  the  Grand  Chapter 
meeting  held  in  Philadelphia  the  next  year.  Nine  other  Grand  Chapter 
offices  have  been  held  by  members  of  the  Xi  Chapter.  In  October,  1877, 
the  Xi  Chapter  assisted  the  Metropolitan  Chapter  of  Zeta  Psj  of  Cleve- 
land in  entertaining  the  thirty-first  annual  session  of  the  Grand  Chap- 
ter, which  met  that  year  in  Cleveland.  Lewis  S.  Pilcher,  '62,  was  a 
member  of  the  committee  which  published  the  second  catalogue  of  the 
fraternity  in  October,  1867,  and  he  made  the  report  of  that  committee  to 
the  Grand  Chapter.  John  E.  Ensign,  '74,  and  Frank  H.  Culver,  '75, 
have  also  been  prominently  identified  with  the  work  of  the  general  fra- 
ternity. William  Lyman  Otis,  '74,  so  well  known  for  his  extensive 
work  as  a  Grand  Chapter  officer,  although  originally  of  the  Pi  Chapter, 
represented  the  Xi,  his  affiliated  chapter,  in  four  conventions. 

The  Xi  Chapter  has  been  actively  identified  with  the  successful 
extension  of  the  fraternity;  the  Psi,  Cornell,  and  the  Theta  Xi,  Toronto, 
being  among  the  chapters  established  through  the  instrumentality  of  the 
Michigan  chapter.  N.  P.  Cochran,  '64,  entered  Harvard  in  the  fall  of 
1864  and  reorganized  the  Rho  Chapter  with  twelve  of  the  best  men  in 
Harvard.  The  Rho  had  been  dormant  since  1856. 

In  the  forty  years  of  its  existence  at  the  University  of  Michigan  Zeta 
Psi  has  initiated  282  men.  The  Chapter  has  enrolled  at  different  times 
one  man  from  the  Phi  Chapter,  New  York  University;  one  from  the  Zeta, 
Williams;  three  from  the  Chi,  Colby;  one  from  the  Theta,  Union;  one 
from  the  Tau.  Lafayette;  two  from  the  Pi,  Rensselaer  Polytechnic  In- 
stitute; two  from  the  Psi,  Cornell;  two  from  the  Omega,  Chicago;  one 
from  the  Iota,  California,  and  one  from  the  Eta,  Yale.  In  all,  fourteen 
members  of  other  chapters  are  also  included  in  the  membership  of  the 
Xi. 

The  chapter  has  lost  fifty-two  members  by  death.  It  has  at  pres- 
ent, January  1,  1900,  207  living  members. 

The  fraternity  system  has  developed  rapidly  at  the  University  of 
Michigan,  and  at  present  the  fraternities  wield  great  influence  and  form  an 
important  element  in  the  life  of  the  University.  Four  or  five  of  the  older 
societies  own  handsome  and  costly  houses,  purchased  for  them  by  their 
alumni,  while  many  others  have  accumulated  valuable  property.  Cordial 
relations  exist  between  the  faculties  and  the  societies,  many  of  the  pro- 
fessors being  members  of  fraternities  and  interested  in  the  maintenance 
of  a  high  standard  of  scholarship  among  the  members  of  their  own  socie- 
ties. In  the  fraternity  life  itself  the  tendency  is  upward.  The  freedom 
from  restraint,  which  was  urged  as  an  objection  to  fraternity  life,  is  no 
longer  desired  nor  is  it  possible.  The  chapters  rather  take  pride  in 
maintaining  a  high  stand  in  college,  and  most  of  the  members  are  very 
jealous  of  the  good  name  of  their  fraternities.  In  college  enterprises  is 
the  influence  of  the  fraternities  especially  felt.  They  act  as  units  in 
supporting  the  various  college  interests — athletic,  musical,  journalistic 
and  social.  In  this  development  Zeta  Psi  has  had  an  honorable  part. 
She  has  done  faithfully  and  well  the  work  allotted  to  her,  and  has  been 
rewarded  with  her  full  share  of  college  honors. 

The  chapter  life  to-day  tends  toward  high  ideals  of  scholarship,  so- 
cial training,  and  mutual  helpfulness.  The  excellent  principles  of  the 


532  XI  CHAPTER 

fraternity  are  practical  as  well  as  theoretical.  The  scholarship  and 
the  morale  of  the  chapter  are  carefully  watched  by  the  older  members, 
under  a  regular  system  in  the  chapter  life,  which  is  felt  unconsciously 
rather  than  enforced  by  any  fixed  set  of  rules.  Thus  the  Xi  endeavors 
to  supplement  the  university  training-  with  a  fraternal  discipline  that 
should  make  her  sons  a  credit  to  their  Alma  Mater  and  to  Zeta  Psi.

HISTORY  OF  THE  PI  CHAPTER 

The  Pi  Chapter  of  Zeta  Psi,  the  sixteenth  in  the  order  of  establish- 
ment, had  its  origin  in  Amherst  College.  In  1858-9  two  Zetes,  Charles 
Goodrich  King-,  Epsilon  '60,  and  William  DeForest  Prentis,  Phi '57,  were 
students  at  Amherst.  These  men,  together  with  James  Brown  Mason  Gros- 
venor,  Epsilon  '62,  acting  under  authority,  initiated  eight  men  during  the 
college  year  1858-9  and  the  first  part  of  1859-60.  Conditions,  however, 
were  not  favorable;  the  chapter  never  had  any  real  existence,  and  by  the 
end  of  1859  all  attempt  at  continuing  the  organization  was  given  up. 

Six  years  later  the  chapter  at  Rensselaer  Polytechnic  Institute  was 
founded.  At  the  time  this  chapter  was  established  it  was  referred  to  as 
"transferring  the  Amherst  Chapter  to  the  Rensselaer  Polytechnic  Insti- 
tute." It  does  not  appear  that  there  was  any  connection  between  these 
two  attempts  to  introduce  Zeta  Psi;  no  students  initiated  at  Amherst  went 
from  there  to  the  Rensselaer  Polytechnic  Institute.  The  name  Pi  Chapter 
was,  however,  applied  to  the  Troy  Chapter,  and  all  subsequently  pub- 
lished catalogues  of  the  fraternity  emphasized  this  idea  by  publishing 
the  list  of  members  initiated  at  Amherst  and  Rensselaer  Polytechnic 
Institute  under  the  one  heading,  Pi  Chapter,  and  for  this  reason  the 
same  plan  is  here  adopted. 

Rensselaer  Polytechnic  Institute  of  Troy,  New  York,  was  founded 
in  1826,  by  Hon.  Stephen  Van  Rensselaer,  LL.  D.,  as  the  "Rensselaer 
School"  for  the  teaching  of  science.  It  was  a  pioneer  in  this  work, 
being  the  first  technical  school  in  America  which  was  independent  of 
government  aid.  There  was  no  fund  for  endowment,  Mr.  Van  Rensselaer 
making  himself  responsible  for  the  general  expenses.  In  a  three  years' 
course  there  was  no  instruction  in  the  dead  or  foreign  languages,  the 
course  consisting  chiefly  of  geology,  zoology,  botany,  chemistry,  miner- 
alogy and  mathematics.  The  first  class,  consisting  of  nine  men,  was 
graduated  with  the  degree  of  bachelor  of  science  in  1829,  and  the  first  de- 
gree in  engineering,  that  of  civil  engineer,  was  here  conferred  in  1835. 

In  1849  a  general  reorganization  was  effected,  the  number  of  instruc- 
tors was  increased,  and  the  scope  of  the  work  extended,  "with  a  view  to 
enable  it  to  discharge  with  all  possible  efficiency  its  intended  functions 
as  a  Polytechnic  Institute,  including  those  in  a  more  special  sense  of  a 
College  of  Engineering. "  The  present  name  was  assumed  in  1861.  Since 
1885,  the  course  in  engineering  has  been  supplemented  by  a  course  in 
general  science.  The  Institute  has  been  largely  self-supporting  since 
its  foundation,  although  it  has  received  a  few  gifts  from  individuals,  and 
has  shared  to  a  small  extent  in  the  general  appropriations  for  educa- 
tional purposes  of  the  State. 

The  Institute  has  sent  forth  a  large  number  of  graduates,  who,  as 
professors  and  teachers  of  the  mathematical  and  physical  sciences,  as 
practical  chemists  and  geologists,  and  as  engineers  in  the  various  de- 
partments of  constructive  and  topographical  art,  have  contributed  very 
largely  to  the  diffusion  of  science,  as  well  as  its  applications  to  the 
business  pursuits  of  life.  Through  the  lack  of  a  general  endowment,  it 
has  hardly  kept  pace  with  the  large  number  of  technical  schools  and 
schools  of  applied  science  of  the  universities  organized  in  recent  years. 
In  1899-1900,  the  number  of  instructors  was  17,  students  165. 

June  13,  1865,  Zeta  Psi  was  formally  established  in  Rensselaer 
Polytechnic  Institute  by  a  committee  consisting  of  John  Lamson  Flagg, 
Rho;  La  Motte  Wallace  Rhodes,  Theta;  Walter  Howard  Moore,  Epsilon; 
Charles  Penrose  Perkins,  Sigma;  Fred.  Charles  Thayer,  Chi,  and  David 
Fansler  Rank,  Eta  (Pennsylvania  College).  The  chapter  owes  its  exist- 
ence largely  to  the  efforts  of  Hon.  John  Lamson  Flagg,  Rho  '57,  a 


576  PI  CHAPTER 

prominent  citizen  of  Troy,  mayor  of  Troy  for  two  terms,  ex-officio  trustee 
of  the  Institute,  and  member  of  the  House  of  Representatives  at  Albany. 
Until  his  death  in  1874,  he  was  actively  interested  in  the  chapter's  pros- 
perity. The  charter  members  were  Satterlee  Arnold,  '66;  Albion  Mealy 
Christie,  '67;  John  Stewart  Schaeffer,  '66;  Jose"  Hernandez,  '67,  and 
Guillermo  Pasmal  Gonzalez,  '68.  At  the  meeting  of  the  Grand  Chapter 
at  New  York,  December  27,  1865,  the  new  chapter  was  represented  for 
the  first  time  by  two  delegates;  the  ASA  was  requested  to  send  a 
charter  to  the  Pi  Chapter;  the  charter  was  properly  executed  and  signed 
by  Charles  Phelps,  Epsilon,  $  A ;  Henry  T.  Thomas,  Omega,  2  A,  and 
Henry  Plowman,  Eta  (Pennsylvania  College),  A  2  A,  and  the  Pi  Chapter 
was  thus  formally  added  to  the  chapter  roll  of  the  fraternity. 

There  were  at  this  time  three  other  fraternities  having  chapters  at 
Troy,  two  having  been  established  in  1864  and  the  third  in  1853.  The 
fraternity  system  had  met  with  great  favor  and  the  chapter  of  Zeta  Psi, 
starting  under  auspicious  circumstances,  was  at  once  recognized  as  an 
important  factor  in  college  circles,  attaining  a  high  rank,  which,  with 
one  or  two  lapses  due  to  the  constant  danger  of  weakening  through  small 
numbers,  it  maintained  throughout  its  life.  Considering  the  small 
number  of  students  at  Rensselaer  Polytechnic  Institute,  many  of  whom, 
attending  for  special  work,  did  not  remain  in  college  long,  and  the  small 
number  initiated  each  year,  averaging  about  four,  the  record  of  the 
chapter  in  maintaining  a  continuous  existence  for  nearly  thirty  years 
speaks  well  for  the  harmony  among  its  members  and  their  zeal  for  Zeta 
Psi.  During  the  first  half  of  the  chapter's  life  the  average  active  mem- 
bership was  twelve;  in  later  years  this  number  was  considerably  re- 
duced. 

From  the  start  the  Pi  Chapter  was  active  in  the  proceedings  of  the 
Grand  Chapter.  The  chapter  was  usually  represented  by  a  full  delega- 
tion and  in  this  respect  no  chapter  of  the  fraternity  has  a  better  record. 
The  Grand  Chapter  was  entertained  at  Troy  by  the  Pi,  at  its  meeting 
January  3,  1879.  The  Pi  took  a  prominent  part  in  the  establishment  of  the 
Psi  Chapter  at  Cornell  University.  The  entire  fraternity  is  indebted  to 
the  Pi  for  adding  to  its  membership  one  of  the  noblest  of  all  Zetes,  Wil- 
liam Lyman  Otis. 

Throughout  the  chapter's  existence  clubrooms  were  maintained.  In 
the  early  seventies  these  rooms  were  in  the  Museum  Building  and  con- 
sisted of  the  council  room,  library  and  lounging  room.  Annual  reunions 
were  held  for  a  number  of  years  at  commencement  time.  At  times  the 
chapter  had  to  fight  hard  for  existence.  In  the  fall  of  1881,  but  two  men 
returned;  these,  with  the  aid  of  the  resident  elders,  initiated  three  men; 
later  one  of  the  older  men  returned,  and  with  an  active  membership  of  six 
a  crisis  was  safely  passed. 

In  January,  1883,  the  chapter  removed  to  a  suite  of  four  rooms,  at  11 
Second  Street,  one  of  the  best  locations  for  clubrooms  in  Troy,  and  these 
rooms  were  retained  as  long  as  the  chapter  continued  to  exist.  In  the 
fall  of  the  same  year  nine  men  returned,  three  were  initiated  and  a  suc- 
cessful year,  followed  by  an  era  of  prosperity,  resulted.  One  of  the  feat- 
ures of  the  chapter  life  was  the  "rushing"  made  necessary  by  the 
intense  rivalry  of  the  seven  fraternities  which  were  by  this  time  repre- 
sented at  Troy.  In  this  strife  Zeta  Psi  came  out  with  more  than  her 
fair  share  of  the  honors. 

In  the  rooms  on  Second  Street  the  chapter  led  an  uninterrupted  life 
until  1893.  The  attendance  at  the  Institute  still  remained  small  with 
no  prospects  for  an  increase;  the  number  in  each  entering  class,  avail- 
able for  fraternity  membership,  seemed  to  be  diminishing  instead  of  in- 
creasing; the  outlook  was  not  at  all  promising.  The  active  members 
having  at  heart  the  best  interests  of  the  fraternity,  after  careful  con- 
sideration in  consultation  with  Grand  Chapter  officers  and  elders  of  the 
chapter,  decided  to  give  up  the  charter  and  on  December  21,  1893,  the 
chapter  was  discontinued  after  an  honorable  career  of  twenty-eight

years.     The  present  members  of  the  Pi  Chapter  at  Rensselaer  Polytech- 
nic Institute  number  121,  of  whom       are  deceased. 

The  Pi  Chapter  Zetes  are  scattered  over  a  wide  field  of  labor.  Many 
of  them  are  actively  engaged  in  engineering  work  in  the  United  States 
and  elsewhere.  Zeta  Psi,  through  the  Pi  Chapter,  is  represented  in 
South  America,  Puerto  Rico  and  Cuba;  several  hold  positions  of  trust 
and  responsibility  in  New  York  City.  Their  associations  in  college 
with  fellow  fraternity  members  were  intimate  and  cordial,  and  they  are 
ever  ready  to  extend  to  a  brother  Zete  a  hearty  greeting  with  assurance 
of  sincere  Zeta  Psi  fellowship.

HISTORY  OF  THE  ETA  CHAPTER 

(PENNSYLVANIA  COLLEGE) 

Pennsylvania  College,  situated  at  Gettysburg-,  Pa.,  was  founded  in 
1832,  as  a  result  of  the  demand  for  an  academic  training  preparatory  to 
admission  into  the  Theological  Seminary,  established  at  Gettysburg  by 
the  Lutheran  Church,  in  1826.  The  college  has  been  maintained  chiefly 
through  contributions  from  the  Lutheran  Church,  although  early  in  its 
history  two  appropriations,  amounting  in  all  to  $24,500,  were  obtained 
from  the  State  of  Pennsylvania.  The  college  has  continued  under  the 
auspices  of  the  Lutheran  Church  and  has  grown  from  a  small  institution, 
with  but  one  building,  to  an  equipment  including  extensive  grounds  with 
ten  buildings.  The  regular  undergraduate  courses  are  given  and  for 
many  years  a  preparatory  department  formed  part  of  the  work  of  the 
college,  enrolling  a  large  number  of  the  students  of  the  college.  In 
1899-1900,  the  faculty  numbered  sixteen  and  the  students  263. 

A  petition  from  students  at  Pennsylvania  College  having  been  pre- 
sented, the  establishment  of  a  chapter  of  Zeta  Psi  at  that  institution  was 
duly  authorized  by  the  Grand  Chapter,  at  its  meeting  held  at  Hanover, 
N.  H.,  July  24,  1860.  Howard  R.  Hetrick,  '61  Tau,  and  Frank  M.  Todd, 
'63  Tau,  were  appointed  a  committee  by  the  Tau  Chapter,  at  Lafayette 
College,  to  proceed  to  Gettysburg,  and  to  formally  establish  the  chapter 
by  initiating  the  petitioners.  Todd  was  unable  to  attend  and  the  duties 
of  initiation  and  instruction  were  fulfilled  by  Hetrick.  August  13,  1861, 
the  chapter  was  founded  by  the  initiation  of  Mason  Weidman, '62,  Thomas 
Duncan  Renfrew,  '61,  and  Henry  Plowman,  '61,  to  whom  were  added  the 
following  day,  Joseph  Potts  Blymyer, '63,  John  C.  Lane, '61,  and  Charles 
Mathias  George,  '65.  Of  the  six  charter  members  all  but  Henry  Plowman 
have  since  died. 

At  the  very  beginning  the  chapter  met  with  trials  and  disturbances 
incident  to  the  Civil  War,  in  which  several  of  its  members  volunteered 
and  served  with  honorable  records.  When  in  June,  1863,  General  Robert 
E.  Lee  began  his  invasion  of  the  loyal  States  by  crossing  the  Potomac, 
the  patriotic  impulse  among  the  students  led  to  prompt  action,  resulting 
in  about  sixty,  a  majority  of  the  college  students,  five  of  whom  were  Zetes, 
responding  to  Governor  Curtin's  callfor  50,000men  for  the  emergency.  The 
student  company  reported  at  Harrisburg,  and  had  the  honorable  distinc- 
tion of  being  the  first  company  mustered  in  under  this  call.  The  company 
was  ordered  at  once  to  Gettysburg,  where  the  Confederate  invasion  culmi- 
nated in  the  sanguinary  battle  of  Gettysburg,  July  1,  2  and  3,  1863,  in 
which  many  of  the  college  students  participated.  College  exercises  were 
practically  suspended  until  fall  of  that  year,  and  much  damage  having 
been  done  to  the  grounds  and  the  building  which  was  used  as  a  hospital 
first  by  the  Confederate  Army  and,  after  its  retreat,  by  the  Union  Arm}-. 
Thefollowing  interesting  item  isfound  in  the  minutes  of  the  Grand  Chapter 
meeting  held  at  New  York,  Dec.  30,  1863:  "It  is  recommended  that  the 
Grand  Officers  be  instructed  to  supply  the  place  of  the  charter  issued  to 
the  Eta  Chapter,  it  having  been  destroyed  during  the  late  invasion  of 
Gettysburg." 

The  chapter  continued  initiating  a  few  men  each  year  and  with  rep- 
resentation in  almost  every  Grand  Chapter  meeting,  until  1871.  Condi- 
tions, however,  were  not  favorable  for  successful  fraternity  life,  the  college 
was  small  and  the  fraternity  spirit  weak.  The  last  initiations  were  held 
in  1870,  and  the  chapter  formally  ceased  to  exist  June,  1872,  after  having 
added  to  the  present  membership  of  Zeta  Psi,  during  its  ten  years  of 
activity,  thirty-seven  men,  fifteen  of  whom  are  deceased.  The  charter 
and  records  were  deposited  with  a  custodian  and  later  were  turned 
over  to  a  committee  appointed  by  the  Grand  Chapter  to  receive  them.

HISTORY  OF  THE  OMEGA  CHAPTER 

In  the  autumn  of  1863  the  members  of  the  Quodrumvirs,  a  local  so- 
ciety of  ten  members  in  the  University  of  Chicago,  petitioned  the  Grand 
Chapter  for  a  charter.  At  that  time  no  national  Greek-letter  fraternity 
had  found  footing  west  of  Ann  Arbor.  The  action  of  the  Quodrumvirs 
was  determined  largely  by  their  acquaintance  with  certain  alumni  mem- 
bers of  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity  residing  in  Chicago,  and  also  by  the 
efforts  of  Bro.  Thomas  Parker,  Jr. ,  who  had  joined  the  fraternity  at  Ann 
Arbor  and  had  recently  transferred  his  scholarship  to  the  University  of 
Chicago,  thus  becoming  a  member  of  the  class  of  1864.  The  petition  was 
presented  by  Bro.  Nathan  P.  Cochran,  3,  at  the  session  of  the  Grand 
Chapter,  held  in  New  York  City,  December  30,  1863.  It  was  granted  by 
unanimous  vote,  after  favorable  remarks  by  Bros.  Henry  W.  Stevenson, 
S,  and  John  J.  Rice,  $,  who  were  personally  acquainted  with  the  merits 
of  the  case,  and  by  others.  On  motion  of  Bro.  Amasa  A.  Redfield,  $, 
the  Xi  Chapter  was  appointed  the  committee  of  induction  and  all  details 
of  the  ceremony  were  left  to  its  discretion. 

There  was  some  delay  in  organizing  the  new  chapter  and  at  the  con- 
vention held  in  Schenectady,  July  26,  1864,  it  was  resolved  that  the  Xi 
Chapter  have  the  best  wishes  of  the  Grand  Chapter  for  the  establishment 
of  a  chapter  at  the  University  of  Chicago.  Finally,  on  Saturday,  No- 
vember 5,  1864,  the  induction  ceremonies  took  place  at  the  hall  of  the 
Quodrumvirs,  No.  16  Portland  Block,  corner  of  Washington  and  Dearborn 
Streets,  Chicago.  The  founders  were :  Bros.  Edwin  Francke  Leonard, 
E;  Franc  Byron  Wilkie,  0;  Wallace  W.  Corbett,  E;  Rodney  Welch,  X; 
George  H.  Hulburt,  E;  Henry  M.  Bodfish,  X;  Harry  Plowman,  Jr.,  H, 
and  Thomas  Parker,  Jr. ,  S.  The  six  charter  members  initiated  at  this 
time  were:  Joseph  Francis  Bonfield,  '64;  William  Lewis  Pierce,  '65; 
Louis  Clark  Jones,  '65;  Jasper  William  Porter,  '65;  George  James  Rich- 
ardson, '66,  and  Henry  Theodore  Thomas,  '64.  The  Omega  Chapter 
was  then  duly  organized  by  the  election  of  officers.  A  dinner  at  Ambrose 
&  Jackson's,  on  Clark  Street,  followed,  at  which  Bro.  Leonard  presided. 
At  the  eighteenth  annual  meeting  of  the  Grand  Chapter,  held  in  New 
York  City,  December  28,  1864,  on  motion  of  Bro.  La  Motte  W.  Rhodes,  &, 
it  was  resolved  to  welcome  the  Omega  Chapter  into  the  fraternity  and  to 
send  it  a  charter.  Pierson  David  Smith,  '66,  a  Quodrumvir,  was  ini- 
tiated December  27,  1864,  and  Bro.  Thomas  Parker,  Jr.,  £,  was  received 
by  transfer.  Thus,  with  a  membership  of  eight  chosen  and  tried  friends, 
the  new  chapter  began  the  new  year  with  every  prospect  of  a  successful 
and  unbroken  career. 

During  1865  nine  new  members  were  added,  as  follows :  March  21, 
Amos  Blood  Pollock,  '66;  October  27,  Alexander  Henderson,  '67;  November 
3,  John  Semple  Hair,  '67;  November  17,  Frederick  Clarence  Nicholas,  '69; 
Perry  Trumbull,  '69;  Frederick  Stanberry,  '69,  and  Charles  Linnaeus 
Allen,  '69;  December  1,  Charles  Parker,  '66;  and  December  21,  Alonzo 
Abernethy,  '66.  The  initiation  of  Bros.  Pollock  and  Parker,  the  two  re- 
maining Quodrumvirs,  the  former  a  captain  and  the  latter  a  major  of  U.  S. 
Volunteers,  had  been  delayed  by  their  absence  in  the  army.  The  tenth 
Quodrumvir,  Henry  Giles  Spring,  met  with  sudden  death  by  accident. 
He  had  looked  forward  with  enthusiasm  to  becoming  a  Zeta  Psi,  and  had 
he  lived  would  have  honored  the  fraternity.  Bro.  Abernethy's  college 
course  had  also  been  interrupted  by  absence  in  the  army.  He  enlisted 
in  1861  as  a  private  and  returned  lieut. -colonel  of  the  9th  Iowa  Volunteers, 
taking  his  degree  of  A.  B.  in  1866. 

The  Alumni  members  resident  in  Chicago,  and  notably  the  founders, 
took  active  and  continuous  interest  in  the  welfare  of  the  new  chapter. 
Their  faces  were  almost  as  familiar  in  the  chapter  hall  as  those  of  the 


612  OMEGA  CHAPTER 

younger  members,  and  they  stood  always  ready  to  help  with  wise  coun- 
sel and  open  purse.  The  same  measure  of  interest  on  the  part  of  resi- 
dent Alumni  at  the  fraternity  centres  would  add  tremendous  force  to  the 
influence  of  the  fraternity  everywhere. 

The  Omega  was  represented  for  the  first  time  in  the  Grand  Chapter 
at  its  nineteenth  annual  convention  in  New  York  City,  December  27, 
1865,  Bro.  Henry  T.  Thomas  being  the  delegate.  At  this  convention  the 
Xi  and  Omega  Chapters  petitioned  for  the  next  regular  convention  to  be 
held  at  Chicago,  but  the  petition  was  denied  by  a  vote  of  8  to  9.  However, 
at  a  later  session  Bro.  Thomas  moved  that  there  be  an  extra  meeting  of  the 
Grand  Chapter  on  or  about  the  first  day  of  July,  1866,  in  the  city  of 
Chicago,  the  opening  session  to  be  public  and  the  exercises  to  consist  of 
a  poem  and  an  oration  to  be  delivered  by  members  appointed  at  the  present 
session  of  the  Grand  Chapter.  This  motion  was  carried,  and  Bros. 
Isaac  S.  Kalloch,  X,  and  William  H.  McElroy,  0,  were  appointed  orator 
and  poet  respectively.  At  the  election  of  grand  officers  Bro.  Thomas 
was  chosen  2  A.  The  year  1866  was  a  prosperous  and  notable  one  for 
the  Omega  Chapter,  and  seven  new  members  were  initiated,  as  follows: 
February  9,  William  Wallace  Faris,  '66;  July  4,  Henry  A.  Gardner, 
'68,  and  Charles  Emil  Richard  Miiller,  '68;  September  21,  John  Warren 
Shipman,  '69;  October  12,  Chester  A.  Babcock,  '70;  October  19,  John 
Stephen  Buhrer,  '68,  and  November  3,  Josiah  Ellmore  Cramer,  '69. 

In  June,  1866,  The  Zeta  Psi,  a  four-page  paper,  was  published  by 
the  chapter,  Bros.  Charles  Parker  and  William  Wallace  Faris  being 
the  editors.  On  the  Fourth  of  July  the  corner  stone  of  a  monument  to  Hon. 
Stephen  A.  Douglas,  the  founder  and  most  generous  patron  of  the  Uni- 
versity, and  ex-President  of  the  Board  of  Trustees,  was  laid  on  the  lake 
shore  near  the  University  buildings  by  President  Andrew  Johnson,  at- 
tended by  his  entire  Cabinet.  On  the  following  day,  July  5,  the  special 
meeting  of  the  Grand  Chapter,  and  the  first  ever  held  west  of  Schenectady, 
N.  Y.,  convened  at  the  hall  of  the  Omega  Chapter,  No.  16  Portland  Block. 
In  the  absence  of  the  $  A,  Bro.  Henry  T.  Thomas,  fl,  2  A,  called  the 
convention  to  order,  and  upon  his  motion,  Bro.  Truman  H.  S  afford,  P, 
was  chosen  to  preside  as  3>A,pro  tern.  In  the  evening  the  literary  exer- 
cises were  publicly  held  at  the  First  Baptist  Church.  They  consisted 
of  an  oration  by  Rev.  Bro.  Isaac  S.  Kalloch,  X,  and  a  poem  by  Bro. 
William  H.  McElroy,  0,  who  took  for  his  theme,  "Whatever  is,  is  West. " 
The  attendance  was  large  and  the  audience  justly  enthusiastic. 

At  the  session  of  the  convention  held  the  following  day  it  appeared 
from  the  report  of  the  Catalogue  Committee  that  a  balance  of  $370  was 
needed  to  cover  the  cost  of  publishing,  whereupon  this  amount  was  sub- 
scribed within  a  few  minutes.  The  Xi  and  Omega  Chapters  extended 
an  invitation  to  a  lake  excursion  on  the  steamer  "Orion"  and  to  a  banquet 
at  the  Briggs  House,  and  Bro.  Safford,  P,  Director  of  the  Dearborn  Obser- 
vatory, invited  the  delegates  to  visit  the  observatory  and  to  "see  stars" 
through  the  new  telescope,  a  special  train  of  cars  having  been  provided 
for  the  purpose.  Both  excursions  were  accepted  and  both  proved  most 
enjoyable.  There  was  a  goodly  attendance  of  members  from  the  far 
East,  and  they  took  occasion  to  thank  their  Western  brothers  in  formal 
resolutions,  published  afterward  in  the  minutes  of  1866,  for  their  kind- 
ness and  hospitality.  Altogether  the  affair  was  most  successful  through- 
out and  added  much  to  the  prestige  of  the  fraternity  in  the  West. 

At  the  twentieth  convention  of  the  Grand  Chapter,  in  New  York  City, 
December  20  and  21,  1866,  the  Omega  was  represented  by  Bros.  Henry 
T.  Thomas,  fl,  and  Edwin  Francke  Leonard,  E.  At  the  twenty-first 
convention,  New  York  City,  December  27  and  28,  1867,  the  Omega  Chap- 
ter was  honored  by  the  election  of  its  delegate,  Bro.  Henry  T.  Thomas, 
as  $  A.  In  the  year  1867  three  new  members  were  added  by  initiation : 
March  14,  George  Bronson  Woodworth,  '66 ;  March  21,  Henry  Farns- 
worth  Frink,  '68,  and  Ferdinand  Wythe  Peck,  '68.  The  tenth  anniver- 
sary of  the  Xi  Chapter  was  observed  by  a  reunion  at  Ann  Arbor,  June  23, 


OMEGA  CHAPTER  613 

1868.  The  Omega  Chapter  had  been  invited,  and  the  members  attended 
in  a  body,  thereby  giving  themselves  much  pleasure  and  also  acknowl- 
edging in  a  fitting  manner  their  sense  of  obligation  to  the  Xi  for  its  kind 
offices  in  helping  to  bring  about  the  establishment  of  the  Omega. 

During  the  years  1867  and  1868  the  attendance  of  students  at  the 
University  had  fallen  off  materially  because  of  its  financial  difficulties, 
and,  in  consequence,  there  was  little  desirable  material  from  which  to 
recruit  new  members.  As  stated  above,  only  three  additions  to  the 
membership  were  made  in  1867,  and,  in  keeping  with  the  uniform  policy 
of  considering  quality  and  not  numbers,  only  three  were  initiated  in  1888, 
to  wit:  Ellis  Sylvester  Chesbrough,  Jr.,  '71;  Clinton  Allen  Snowden, 
'71,  and  Eliakim  Raymond  Bliss,  '72. 

At  the  twenty-second  annual  meeting  of  the  Grand  Chapter,  in  New 
York  City,  December  30,  1868,  Bro.  Henry  T.  Thomas,  £1,  #  A,  who 
during  the  year  had  visited  ten  of  the  chapters  and  found  all  save  the 
Rho  in  a  flourishing  condition,  had  the  painful  duty  of  reporting  to  the 
convention  that  "from  causes  wholly  outside  the  control  of  the  frater- 
nity, ' '  the  Omega  Chapter  had  dissolved  for  the  present,  adding,  how- 
ever, that  he  hoped  to  see  it  revived  under  more  favorable  circumstances. 
The  Omega  went  down  with  its  flag  at  the  masthead  and  with  no  abate- 
ment of  loyalty  nor  devotion  on  the  part  of  its  twenty-nine  members.  As 
a  further  acknowledgment  of  this  spirit  the  Grand  Chapter,  immediately 
following  this  announcement,  reelected  its  only  representative  present, 
Bro.  Henry  T.  Thomas,  to  the  office  of  $  A,  for  the  ensuing  year. 

In  the  autumn  of  1869  the  Omega  was  called  upon  to  mourn  the  first 
break  in  its  circle  through  the  untimely  death  of  its  best-beloved  mem- 
ber, Bro.  Louis  Clark  Jones.  On  the  loth  of  November,  at  a  meeting  of 
the  Chicago  resident  members  of  the  fraternity,  the  following  action  was 
taken: 

"It  having  pleased  our  Heavenly  Father  to  call  from  this  life  our 
brother  in  Zeta  Psi  and  friend,  we,  who  have  known  him  well,  shared 
with  him  many  happy  hours,  been  instructed  by  his  words,  charmed  by 
his  social  qualities  and  edified  by  his  moral  excellence,  mourn  his  death 
as  a  friend,  companion  and  brother.  Our  sympathies  are  with  the 
friends  and  relatives  of  our  brother  in  this  bereavement,  and  they  are 
assured  that  his  memory  is  the  noblest  and  best  of  our  lives ;  that  his 
was  a  life  of  true  manhood,  true  honor  and  true  friendship. 

'  None  knew  him  but  to  love  him ; 
None  named  him  but  to  praise."' 

To  keep  the  lamp  of  Zeta  Psi  burning  " on  the  Western  picket  line," 
the  resident  and  neighboring  Alumni  met  at  Chicago,  March  30,  1872,  and 
organized  the  "Northwestern  Association  of  Zeta  Psi."  Its  first  annual 
banquet  followed  immediately.  The  attendance  was  large  and  the  re- 
union enjoyable  in  every  way.  This  organization  is  still  maintained. 
Bro.  Gardner  G.  Willard,  P,  is  now  its  president,  and  Bro.  Edward  E. 
Yaggy,  H,  secretary,  his  address  being  No.  504  Oxford  Building,  Chicago. 

At  the  thirty-first  convention  of  the  Grand  Chapter,  held  at  Cleveland, 
Ohio,  October  24,  1877,  Bro.  Perry  Trumbull,  fl,  was  chosen  2  A. 

As  one  step  in  the  efforts  made  to  build  up  the  waning  fortunes  of 
the  University  of  Chicago,  it  was  decided  to  give  the  alumni  a  representa- 
tion on  the  Board  of  Trustees,  and  Bro.  Joseph  Francis  Bonfield,  £1  '64, 
was  unanimously  chosen  as  their  representative. 

In  1876,  Bro.  Alonzo  Abernethy,  fl  '66,  was  made  President  of  the 
University,  a  position  which  he  held  until  along  in  1878.  During  that  year, 
the  University  having  taken  a  new,  but,  as  it  appeared  later,  a  short  lease 
of  life,  a  successful  effort  was  made  to  revive  the  Omega  Chapter,  with 
the  result  that  from  1878  to  1884,  twenty-one  new  members  were  initiated, 
most  of  them  in  the  early  part  of  this  period.  But  little  data  for  a  de- 
tailed history  of  the  events  of  these  years  are  now  available,  beyond  the 
facts  given  in  the  biographical  sketches,  which  need  not  be  repeated  here. 


614  OMEGA  CHAPTER 

Suffice  it  to  say,  the  financial  difficulties  of  the  University  rendered 
the  institution  unattractive  to  any  considerable  number  of  ambitious 
students  and  brought  together  little  material  from  which  to  select  desir- 
able men  for  the  chapter  which,  under  these  conditions,  simply  could  not 
flourish.  Repeated  efforts  were  made  successfully  to  fight  against  fate, 
but  to  no  good  purpose  except  to  prove  the  tenacity  of  the  members.  The 
state  of  the  Omega  was  a  frequent  subject  of  anxiety  and  discussion  at 
the  annual  conventions,  notably  those  of  1881  to  1884,  inclusive.  Finally, 
at  the  meeting  of  1885,  it  was  "resolved  that  the  chapter  be  allowed  to 
initiate  no  more  members  until  the  present  financial  condition  of  the 
University  be  settled  and  that  the  active  members  deliver  into  the  hands 
of  the  A  2  A,  the  papers,  archives,  constitution,  charter,  etc.,  until  the 
Grand  Officers  reinstate  the  chapter." 

At  the  meeting  of  1886,  there  being  no  delegate  present  from  the 
Omega,  Bro.  Culver,  &,  advised  the  withdrawal  of  the  charter.  How- 
ever, the  chapter  was  allowed  to  continue  under  the  resolution  of  1885, 
"the  charter  to  be  withdrawn  at  the  next  convention,  unless  the  Grand 
Officers  advise  otherwise."  Finally,  at  the  meeting  of  1887,  the  Omega 
being  again  unrepresented,  Bro,  Culver,  3,  past  A  <?  A,  was  empowered 
to  collect  the  charter,  books,  papers,  etc.  and  transmit  them  to  the  $  A. 

Barring  the  acquisition  of  the  members  who  came  in  after  the  re- 
vival in  1878,  it  is  to  be  regretted  that  any  attempt  was  ever  made  to 
resuscitate  the  chapter,  since,  like  the  University,  it  had  for  the  most 
part  but  a  fitful  and  painful  existence,  yet  it  is  gratifying  to  reflect 
that  the  fault  has  never  lain  with  the  fraternity,  nor  with  those  who 
strove  so  persistently  to  keep  alive  the  torch  of  Zeta  Psi  in  Chicago,  but 
only  with  the  financial  distress  that  culminated  in  the  death  of  the  Uni- 
versity itself. 

Game  to  the  last,  the  Western  brethren  invited  the  Grand  Chapter  to 
hold  the  forty-second  convention  with  them  and  the  sessions  that  sat  in 
Oriental  Hall,  Chicago,  on  the  3d,  4th  and  5th  days  of  January,  1889, 
were  among  the  most  successful  and  enjoyable  ever  known.  At  this 
meeting  Bro.  William  Lewis  Pierce,  £1,  was  chosen  $  A,  and  he  presided 
at  the  succeeding  convention  held  in  New  York  City,  January  3,  1890. 
In  concluding  this  sketch,  it  may  not  be  out  of  place  to  express  the  hope 
that  at  the  new  University  of  Chicago,  now  firmly  established  and  mag- 
nificently endowed,  will  ere  long  witness  the  rebirth  of  the  Omega  Chapter, 
full-fledged,  like  Minerva  from  the  brain  of  Jove,  and  to  predict  for  it  a 
future  in  keeping  with  the  promise  of  its  early  days  and  the  high  hopes 
of  its  founders.

HISTORY  OF  THE  LAMBDA  CHAPTER 

On  the  24th  of  June,  1794,  the  charter  of  Bowdoin  College,  having 
passed  both  houses  of  the  Legislature  of  Massachusetts,  was  signed  by 
Gov.  Samuel  Adams,  thus  giving  to  the  then  so-called  district  of  Maine 
its  first  institution  for  the  higher  education  of  men.  Although  actually 
founded  through  the  munificence  of  neither  individual  nor  denomination, 
the  college  had  as  its  patron  the  Hon.  James  Bowdoin,  ex-Minister  to 
the  courts  of  France  and  Spain,  and  to  his  beneficence  the  college  largely 
owes  its  permanent  foundation. 

It  was  in  1867  that  steps  were  first  taken  to  establish  a  chapter  of 
Zeta  Psi  at  Bowdoin,  and  through  the  persistent  efforts  of  George  Lang- 
don  Chandler,  '68  (formerly  of  the  Chi),  a  charter  was  obtained  and  the 
Lambda  Chapter  was  instituted. 

Of  the  men  to  whom  we  of  the  Lambda  are  indebted  for  a  permanent 
and  successful  organization,  first  and  foremost  stood  George  Langdon 
Chandler,  the  careful  student,  the  enthusiastic  Zeta,  the  upright  citizen. 
Of  the  seven  charter  members,  he  alone  has  passed  over  the  dark  river, 
mourned  by  all  who  knew  him.  The  other  six  survive  their  leader:  Al- 
bert Woodside,  '69,  is  a  practising  physician  in  Rockland,  Me. ;  Charles 
Turner  Torrey,  '70,  also  a  physician,  retired  from  active  practice,  lives  at 
Plympton,  Mass. ;  Davis  True  Timberlake,  '70,  the  Lambda's  only  rep- 
resentative in  the  Civil  War,  is  principal  of  Lancaster  Academy,  N.  H. ; 
Albert  James  Curtis,  '70,  a  retired  teacher,  lives  in  Hanover,  Mass. ; 
Everett  Hammons,  '70,  is  a  prosperous  lawyer  at  Anoka,  Minn.,  and 
Lucien  Howe,  also  of  '70,  is  one  of  America's  most  distinguished  ophthal- 
mologists, residing  in  Buffalo,  N.  Y.  Of  these  men  during  their  college 
course,  Timberlake  and  Torrey,  who  roomed  together,  were  quiet  men  of 
studious  habits;  Curtis  was  of  much  the  same  type;  Hammons  and  Wood- 
side  were  more  active  in  college  affairs,  while  Howe  was  the  society  man 
of  his  class. 

Meetings  were  held  by  the  chapter  for  some  time  in  Topsham;  but 
the  first  hall  of  the  Lambda  was  opposite  the  (Congregational)  "Church 
on  the  Hill,"  until  1876,  when  the  chapter  took  up  its  present  rooms. 
There  was  early  manifest  a  lively  interest  in  literary  work,  as  is  shown 
by  the  chapter's  representation  in  the  two  literary  societies  and  on  the 
editorial  and  managing  staffs  of  the  two  leading  publications  of  the 
college,  the  Orient  and  Bugle. 

From  a  membership  of  7  in  the  spring  of  '68,  the  fall  term  opened 
with  12;  this  was  increased  the  following  year  to  20,  and  the  next  year 
to  23;  while  in  '72  the  chapter  reached  its  numerical  high-water  mark,  28. 

As  early  as  1870,  a  Zeta  Psi  dining-clubwas  formed  at  Mrs.  Baker's, 
opposite  the  college  grounds,  where  the  Brothers  remained  for  three 
years.  But  perhaps  the  most  homelike  spot,  and  that  to  which  the 
thoughts  of  every  Bowdoin  Zeta  turn  with  most  affectionate  recollection, 
isjthe  "Lambda  Club,"  at  the  old  Getchell  homestead.  Founded  in 
1873  as  a  dining-club,  this  comfortable  house  has  become  a  veritable 
home  for  our  undergraduates,  while  the  latch-string  is  ever  out  for  visit- 
ing Brothers. 

The  Bowdoin  Orient  was  the  result  of  the  journalistic  experience 
of  Bro.  George  Mason  Whitaker,  '72,  while  associated  with  him  on 
the  board  of  five  editors  were  Bros.  H.  M.  Heath  and  J.  S.  Rich- 
ards. The  founding  of  this  paper  had  far-reaching  results  and  brought 
to  immediate  notice  the  prominence  which  the  Lambda  had  attained  at 
its  fourth  anniversary. 

The  men  of  '72  had  much  to  do  with  this  unusually  auspicious  be- 
ginning, they  ranking  high  socially,  physically  and  intellectually,  4  of 
the  7  elected  to  Phi  Beta  Kappa  in  1872  being  from  this  delegation. 


• 
626  LAMBDA  CHAPTER 

The  largest  number  of  candidates  for  the  Lambda  were  from  the  classes 
of  '74  and  '75,  11  from  the  former,  13  from  the  latter;  of  the  former,  4  are 
lawyers,  3  editors,  2  teachers  and  2  have  died.  None  other  has  con- 
ferred greater  honor  upon  our  chapter  than  Henry  Johnson,  Ph.  D.,  '74, 
the  thorough  scholar  and  gentleman  who  is  Longfellow  Professor  of 
Modern  Languages  at  Bowdoin.  Thirteen  is  a  lucky  number  for  the 
delegation  of  '75,  as  all  of  them  are  still  living,  with  5  in  law,  3  in 
medicine,  2  in  agricultural  pursuits,  2  in  editorial  work  and  1  the  super- 
intendent of  school  supplies  for  Greater  New  York. 

The  decade  of  1875-1885  was  one  of  prosperity  for  the  Lambda.  The 
delegations  were  composed  of  men  who  represented  the  chapter  success- 
fully in  the  different  departments  of  college  life.  They  stood  among  the 
highest  in  scholarship  and  athletics  at  Bowdoin.  Since  its  foundation 
the  chapter  has  been  without  a  representative  on  the  nine  for  but  3  out 
of  31  years;  for  24  years  its  representation  on  the  'varsity  team  averaged 
3,  while  for  the  remaining  7  years  the  average  was  2. 

No  men  were  initiated  from  the  class  of  '85,  but  in  the  fall  of  that 
year,  from  the  largest  entering  class  in  several  years,  the  Lambda 
secured  7  men.  One  of  them,  Wilson,  left  at  the  end  of  the  Freshman 
year  to  enter  Williams;  at  the  same  time  Burton  Smith  entered  Bowdoin 
from  Tufts  and  completed  the  course  with  the  six  remaining  members  in 
that  class.  The  next  autumn,  5  men  were  initiated  from  '90,  and  in  the 
fall  of  '87  a  smaller  but  very  able  delegation  from  '91  became  active  and 
influential  Zetas. 

The  four  years  from  1885  to  1889  were  years  of  growth  on  several 
lines.  In  athletics,  we  had  the  finest  pitcher  of  any  Maine  college;  the 
two  regular  catchers;  the  manager  one  year;  and  in  every  year  were 
represented  on  the  team  by  two  or  more  men.  We  had  representatives 
on  all  the  boat  crews  and  the  finest  all-round  athlete  of  the  State  in  Fish, 
'91,  whose  daring  and  skillful  feats  were  the  attraction  of  every  athletic 
meeting.  In  scholarship,  we  captured  the  Smyth  mathematical  prize  of 
$300.00,  the  largest  prize  offered  in  any  Bowdoin  course,  and  tied  for  it 
again;  one  of  our  members  took  in  succession  the  first  prize  in  Sopho- 
more, Junior  and  '68  Prize  Speaking,  and  the  Goodwin  commencement 
prize — the  first  time  that  this  had  been  accomplished  by  any  student  in 
Bowdoin.  We  took  second  honors  in  many  contests;  were  represented  on 
the  Orient  board  by  one  or  more  men  every  year,  and  one  year  had  the 
position  of  editor-in-chief.  Plummer,  '87,  selected  by  the  college  authori- 
ties, wrote  for  the  "Memorial  Volume,"  in  honor  of  Professor  Packard, 
a  poem  which  won  the  highest  praise  from  students,  faculty  and  literary 
critics  and  which  was  widely  copied.  During  this  period  the  chapter 
hall  was  newly  decorated  and  furnished  by  the  elders  and  a  new  piano 
was  purchased  by  the  active  members. 

The  years  following  1889  are  marked  by  the  acquisition  of  strong 
delegations.  Of  the  nine  managers  elected  by  Bowdoin  for  the  Football 
Association,  four  have  been  Zetas,  while  in  '98  and  '99  the  offices  of 
both  manager  and  captain  were  held  by  Brothers  from  '99  and  '00. 

Thrice  during  the  last  decade  we  have  captured  the  Smyth  mathe- 
matical prize,  while  Simpson,  '94,  took  in  succession  all  the  language 
prizes  of  the  college,  the  Smyth  mathematical  prize,  was  on  the  editorial 
staff  of  both  the  college  publications,  and  was  valedictorian.  In  field 
sports  W.  B.  Clarke,  '99,  holds  the  intercollegiate  record  for  the  pole 
vault. 

In  baseball  the  delegation  of  '94  furnished  one  of  the  "star"  batteries 
of  the  State.  In  the  fall  of  '99,  Bro.  Albert  W.  Clarke,  '00,  in  an  inter- 
collegiate football  game  at  Portland,  Me.,  kicked  two  field  goals  from 
placement  (the  first  ever  kicked  in  Maine)  and  one  from  the  forty-yard 
line,  while  all  of  our  representatives  on  the  football  team  have  made  envi- 
able records  for  themselves  since  the  days  of  Tukey,  '91. 

It  is  eminently  fitting,  before  this  history  of  the  Lambda  is  closed,  to 
refer  to  the  lifework  of  its  founder. 


LAMBDA  CHAPTER  627 

George  Langdon  Chandler  was  a  descendant  of  Rev.  Samuel  Lang- 
don,  one  of  the  early  Presidents  of  Harvard  University.  His  parents 
were  of  social  prominence  in  the  town  of  his  birth,  Waterville,  Me.,  his 
father  being1  an  eminent  lawyer.  As  a  child  he  showed  remarkable 
intellectual  possibilities,  and  as  he  grew  older  these  early  promises  bore 
fruit.  He  was  a  young  man  of  small  stature,  with  dark  hair,  black 
eyes,  active  and  alert.  He  was  above  the  average  in  scholarship,  and 
it  is  to  his  faculty  for  making  many  and  strong  friends  that  his  success  in 
founding  the  Lambda  Chapter  is  undoubtedly  due.  After  entering  col- 
lege he  was  prominently  associated  in  all  the  college  work,  and  at  grad- 
uation was  honored  with  election  to  Phi  Beta  Kappa,  while  three  years 
later  Bowdoin  conferred  upon  him  the  degree  of  A.  M.  On  more  than 
one  occasion  he  represented  the  Lambda  Chapter  at  the  conventions  of 
the  Grand  Chapter  and  held  the  office  of  Gamma  Alpha.  His  enthusi- 
astic love  for  Zeta  Psi  never  waned.  He  remained  to  the  last  an  ardent 
worker  for  the  best  interests  of  the  Fraternity. 

It  is  pleasing  to  be  permitted  to  quote  from  the  letters  of  two  of 
Chandler's  intimate  friends  and  co-laborers  in  school  instruction: 

"When  Mr.  Chandler  came  to  Newton  he  took  charge  of  the  Wil- 
liams Grammar  School  at  Auburndale.  After  a  few  very  successful 
years  in  that  school  he  removed  to  the  West,  where,  for  a  short  time,  he 
engaged  in  business.  In  1887  he  returned  to  accept  a  position  in 
the  Newton  High  School.  For  a  few  years  before  his  death  he  was 

Supervisor  of  Nature  Study  in  all  the  Newton  schools 

He  was  a  very  great  worker,  always  busy,  in  school  and  out.  In  his 
classes  his  mind  worked  with  remarkable  rapidity,  engaging  the  utmost 
strength  of  his  pupils  to  keep  pace  with  him.  His  teaching  was  charac- 
terized by  great  breadth.  His  relations  with  his  colleagues  were  always 
of  the  most  pleasant  nature.  Of  unbounded  good  will,  he  could  never 
harbor  a  thought  of  ill  to  any  one.  His  powers  of  conversation  were  ex- 
ceeded by  very  few.  It  is  the  testimony  of  all  that  they  never  passed 
a  dull  moment  with  him.  Had  he  lived  he  would  undoubtedly  have  been 
called  to  New  York  to  take  charge  of  the  Botany  Department  in  the  High 
School  for  Boys  and  Girls.  His  knowledge  of  the  subject  and  his  powers 
of  organization  rendered  him  most  eminently  fit  for  the  position.  .  .  . 

"In  the  community  in  which  he  lived  he  was  a  foremost  man  in  all 
good  movements.  He  was  a  founder  and  officer  of  the  Village  Improve- 
ment Society.  In  politics  he  worked  efficiently  for  the  highest,  best  and 
noblest  ends.  It  can  easily  be  seen  why  he  had  hosts  of  friends,  and 
his  enemies  were  of  such  a  character  that  the  saying,  'we  love  him  for 
the  enemies  he  has  made,'  could  apply  to  no  one  more  truthfully  than 
to  him.  I  have  said  nothing  of  our  personal  relations  for  I  cannot  find 
words  to  express  my  feelings.  We  were  very  near;  our  work  and  our 
tastes  brought  us  together  a  great  deal.  He  was,  what  Dr.  Holmes  says 
he  would  have  a  woman  be:  'as  true  as  death,  kind,  lovable  and  sym- 
pathetic to  a  last  degree. '  I  shall  never  cease  to  miss  him. '  '* 


"  I  was  associated  with  George  L.  Chandler  in  the  Newton  (Mass.) 
High  School  for  a  period  of  ten  years  (1887-1897),  and  came  to  know  him 
quite  intimately. 

"His  specialty  was  biological  science,  and  to  this  he  gave  his  time 
and  strength  without  cessation  and  without  reservation.  Even  his  vaca- 
tions were  used  in  gathering  material  and  making  plans  for  his  classes. 

"During  the  last  three  or  four  years  of  his  life  he  not  only  taught 
botany  in  the  High  School,  but  also  devised  and  put  into  operation  in 
the  elementary  schools  of  the  city  of  Newton  a  carefully  considered, 
elaborate  and  altogether  admirable  scheme  of  'Nature  Study.'  .  .  . 
His  work  in  the  Newton  High  School  was  equally  broad,  accurate  and

sympathetic.  He  revolutionized  the  methods  of  work  in  his  depart- 
ment, and  broug-ht  it  to  such  a  degree  of  efficiency  as  to  command  the 
respect  and  admiration  of  his  colleagues  and  of  the  community  repre- 
sented by  the  school. 

"But  Mr.  Chandler  was  something  more  than  an  accomplished 
scholar  and  a  skilful  teacher;  he  was  a  self-sacrificing  citizen  and  a 
good  man.  I  have  never  known  a  man  more  loyal  to  the  truth.  He  never 
flinched  and  never  shuffled.  The  truth  and  the  right  were  more  precious 
to  him  than  any  reward  that  comes  to  man  through  compliant  misrepre- 
sentation or  ambitious  self-seeking. 

"Mr.  Chandler  was  also  a  lovable  friend  and  a  delightful  com- 
panion. He  was  clear-sighted,  just,  generous,  warm-hearted,  witty  and 
loyal.  Alas,  that  he  should  be  cut  off  in  the  prime  of  his  strength  and 
usefulness! 

' '  The  sum  of  my  pleasure  in  life  was  lessened  when  he  went  out 
from  us. 

'  He  was  a  man,  take  him  all  in  all, 
I  shall  not  look  upon  his  like  again.' "  *

HISTORY  OF  THE  BETA  CHAPTER 

The  University  of  Virginia  was  founded  in  1825  by  Thomas  Jeffer- 
son. Its  foundation  was  one  of  the  three  acts  of  his  life  which  he  re- 
quested to  have  inscribed  upon  his  tombstone,  for  in  the  little  graveyard 
at  Monticello,  the  simple  obelisk  over  his  ashes  bears  the  inscription, 
prepared  by  himself,  "Here  was  buried  Thomas  Jefferson,  Author  of 
the  American  Declaration  of  Independence,  the  Virginia  Statute  for 
Religious  Freedom,  and  Father  of  the  University  of  Virginia." 

Though  the  first  two  apply  to  those  deeds  which  men  can  never  for- 
get, the  foundation  of  the  University  of  Virginia,  perhaps,  has  been  and 
will  be  as  far  reaching  in  its  effects  as  any  act  of  the  great  statesman's 
life. 

It  was  the  first  University  ever  established  in  the  United  States 
upon  the  elective  system,  in  which  the  student  was  left  entirely  to  his 
own  way  of  thinking,  both  in  the  selection  of  studies,  in  his  religious 
life  and  in  self-government.  There  has  never  been  any  curriculum 
whatever,  nor  have  there  been  any  compulsory  studies.  Consequently, 
the  class  system  has  never  existed  at  the  University. 

The  University  proper  is  divided  into  schools,  each  giving  a  separate 
diploma,  and  all  open  to  the  free  election  of  the  student.  No  honorary 
degrees  whatever  are  conferred.  The  degrees  of  Master  of  Arts,  Bache- 
lor of  Arts,  Doctor  of  Philosophy,  Doctor  of  Laws  and  Doctor  of 
Medicine,  when  conferred,  mean  that  their  holders  have  earned  them  by 
graduation  in  the  necessary  schools,  and  that  the  percentage  gained 
upon  examination  has  ranged  from  80  to  90  per  cent,  in  the  100. 

Nothing  is  compulsory  in  the  University  but  gentlemanly  behavior. 
There  is  no  system  of  espionage ;  examinations  are  held  freely  and 
openly,  the  student  going  to  and  coming  from  the  examination  room  as 
he  pleases,  being  only  required  to  sign  a  pledge  that  he  has  neither 
given  nor  received  assistance.  Violations  of  this  pledge  have  been  so 
rare  that  their  number  can  be  counted  on  the  fingers  of  one  hand,  and 
the  violator  in  every  instance  has  been  dealt  with  by  the  student  body, 
who  compelled  the  unfortunate  to  leave  the  University  before  the  Faculty 
could  obtain  knowledge  of  the  fact. 

The  University  had  an  exceptionally  prosperous  period  up  to  1861, 
when  the  entire  student  body,  en  masse,  entered  the  Confederate  army. 
It  opened  again  in  the  fall  of  1865  with  probably  the  most  remarkable 
body  of  students  ever  gathered  in  a  University  r  more  than  half  of  them 
had  served  in  the  Confederate  army,  some  of  them  came  with  one  leg  or 
one  arm  missing,  and  a  more  serious,  hard-working  set  of  students  for 
four  or  five  years  following  the  war  could  not  have  been  found  in  any 
institution  of  learning. 

There  were  but  few  fraternities  at  the  University  prior  to  1860,  and 
the  entire  absence  of  the  class  system  has  always  rendered  the  exist- 
ence of  fraternities  somewhat  precarious. 

In  the  arrangement  of  individual  biographies  it  must  be  borne  in  mind 
that  whilst  class,  years  are  used,  the  year  simply  designates  the  time 
when  the  student  left  the  University  and  is  not  a  distinctive  badge  of 
his  belonging  to  any  class  in  the  institution. 

The  Beta  Chapter  of  Zeta  Psi,  at  the  University  of  Virginia,  was 
established  on  July  28,  1868,  by  Geo.  W.  Graham,  Chas.  F.  McKesson, 
Peter  F.  Pescud  and  H.  P.  Walker,  all  of  the  Upsilon  Chapter,  of  the 
University  of  North  Carolina,  at  Chapel  Hill.  The  days  of  reconstruction 
had  brought  the  grand  old  Chapel  Hill  University  to  the  verge  of  ruin 
and  its  doors  were  closed.  Zeta  Psi  had  always  held  a  high  place  at 
this  University,  and  her  sons  were  ever  loyal  a'nd  true.  Four  of  them 
entered  the  University  of  Virginia  in  1867,  and  applied  for  and  received 


BETA  CHAPTER 

a  charter.  North  Carolinians,  for  the  first  few  years,  were  the  predom- 
inating spirits  in  the  Beta,  and  the  whole-souled  character  of  the  men  of 
that  State  g-ave  the  fraternity  a  tone  of  good-fellowship  and  warm- 
heartedness which  has  ever  characterized  it  at  the  University  of  Vir- 
ginia. The  first  initiate  from  the  State  of  Virginia  was  the  Hon.  Seldon 
Longley. 

The  Beta  took  a  high  stand  amongst  the  fraternities  at  the  Uni- 
versity, and  was  soon  noted  for  the  fraternal  spirit  amongst  its  mem- 
bers. Its  rule  was  never  to  have  a  large  membership,  but  to  insist  that 
the  membership  should  be  first-class  and  ready  to  exemplify  all  that  T 
K  $  indicated  to  the  initiate.  In  1881,  the  chapter  was  allowed  to  be 
discontinued  on  account  of  what  was  deemed  a  lack  of  this  fraternal 
spirit,  but  through  the  efforts  of  some  of  the  elders,  especially  Judge 
R.  T.  W.  Duke,  Jr.,  it  was  reestablished  in  1893  and  has  since  that  time 
taken  a  prominent  place  at  the  University.  The  chapter  now  rents  one 
of  the  University  buildings  and  the  members  gather  under  their  own 
rooftree — Z  W  adorns  the  f agade  in  large  white  letters  and  announces  to 
all  passers-by  that  the  fraternity  is  one  of  the  institutions  of  the  Uni- 
versity. 

The  Beta  has  sent  out  into  the  world  its  share  of  representative 
men.  One  of  the  elders,  Prof.  Paul  B.  Barringer,  is  now  at  the  head 
of  the  University,  being  chairman  of  the  faculty — equivalent  to  president 
— and  the  large  increase  in  attendance  is  largely  attributed  to  his  able 
and  judicious  membership.  In  the  city,  Judge  R.  T.  W.  Duke,  Jr., 
presides  as  the  judge  of  the  Hustings  Court,  and  is  at  present  Grand 
Master  of  Masons  in  Virginia,  and  presided  at  Mt.  Vernon,  Va.,  Dec. 
14,  1899,  on  the  occasion  of  the  commemoration  of  the  one  hundredth 
anniversary  of  the  death  of  Worshipful  George  Washington.  He  is  an 
author  of  some  note,  and  an  orator  whose  services  are  in  demand  in  his 
native  State.  Hon.  Wm.  R.  Duke  represents  the  county  in  which  the 
University  is  situated  in  the  General  Assembly  of  the  State.  Judge 
Charles  L.  Bartlett,  of  class  of  '72,  represents  his  State  in  Congress. 
W.  G.  Charlton  is  a  prominent  member  of  the  bar  in  Savannah.  W.  W. 
Fuller  is  now  the  chief  counsel  of  the  Great  American  Tobacco  Co.  Jas. 
L.  Orr  was  secretary  to  the  Russian  Legation  and  Lieutenant-Governor 
of  South  Carolina.  Thos.  J.  Vivion  is  a  writer  of  prominence  on  the 
Pacific  Coast.  A.  H.  Geolet  and  Chas.  C.  Barrows  are  leading  phy- 
sicians in  New  York.  Elders  of  the  Beta  are  scattered  from  one  end  of 
the  Union  to  another — representative  men  in  every  walk  of  life,  whose 
careers  have  reflected  credit  upon  the  University  and  upon  the  fra- 
ternity.

HISTORY  OF  THE  PSI  CHAPTER 

Cornell  University  was  founded  at  Ithaca,  N.  Y. ,  through  the  munifi- 
cence of  Ezra  Cornell.  The  State  of  New  York  granted  the  proposed 
institution  a  liberal  charter  in  1865,  and  in  1868  Cornell  University  was 
organized  and  its  doors  opened  to  students.  The  size  of  its  endowment 
and  the  ability  of  its  president  and  faculty  convinced  certain  members  of 
the  Xi  Chapter  of  Z  W,  at  the  University  of  Michigan,  that  Cornell  was 
destined  to  be  one  of  the  great  universities  of  this  country,  and  that  it 
would  prove  of  great  advantage  to  Zeta  Psi  if  it  could  be  the  pioneer 
fraternity  at  Ithaca.  Three  active  members  of  the  Xi,  Sherman  S.  Avery, 
'70,  Emil  J.  Coon,  '71,  and  Roy  T.  Hathaway,  '71,  who  left  the  Univer- 
sity of  Michigan  and  entered  Cornell  in  October,  1868,  were  commissioned 
by  the  Xi  to  investigate  the  field  as  a  possible  home  for  a  chapter  of  Zeta 
Psi.  These  Brothers,  although  acting  without  the  necessary  authority 
from  the  Grand  Chapter,  proceeded  to  pledge  for  Zeta  Psi  Frank  R. 
Fowler,  '72,  George  Martin  Luther,  '70,  John  F.  Lyman,  '71,  and 
Miller  A.  Smith,  '71,  and  with  them  prepared  a  petition  to  the  Grand 
Chapter  praying  that  a  charter  be  granted  to  them  for  a  chapter  of  the 
Zeta  Psi  Fraternity  at  Cornell  University.  The  petition  was  presented 
to  the  Grand  Chapter  at  the  convention  held  in  New  York,  Dec.  30  and 
31,  1868.  The  motion  to  grant  a  charter  "was  seconded  and,  after  a 
long  and  most  interesting  debate,  was  passed  unanimously  on  vote  of 
the  chapters  and  grand  officers."  On  motion,  the  non-delegates  from 
Cornell  University  were  admitted  to  seats  in  the  convention,  whereupon 
Bros.  S.  S.  Avery  and  R.  P.  Hathaway  took  seats  as  delegates  from 
the  new  chapter. 

The  Cornell  chapter  was  organized  shortly  after  the  close  of  the  con- 
vention, with  the  Greek  letter  Psi  as  its  chapter  designation.  A  charter 
secured,  the  Psi,  as  the  pioneer  Greek -letter  chapter  at  Cornell,  started 
upon  its  prosperous  career  with  seventeen  active  members.  Being  the 
first  in  the  field,  the  Psi  had  the  pick  of  the  students  at  Cornell,  and 
chose  strong,  energetic  men,  who  at  once  assumed  prominent  positions 
in  the  student  activities  of  the  infant  University.  The  Psi  men  took  a 
leading  part  in  the  publication  of  the  first  issue,  in  the  spring  of  1869, 
of  the  University  annual,  The  Cornellian. 

Convincing  proof  of  the  zeal  and  activity  of  the  new  chapter  was 
given  in  December,  1871,  when  the  Psi  Chapter  invited  the  Grand  Chap- 
ter to  meet  at  Ithaca,  the  following  year,  as  its  guest.  The  invitation 
was  accepted  and  the  twenty-sixth  annual  session  of  the  Grand  Chapter 
was  held  at  Ithaca  with  the  Psi  Chapter.  The  willingness  of  the  Psi 
Chapter  to  work  for  the  fraternity  at  large  was  also  evinced  by  the 
publication  of  the  first  Zeta  Psi  Song  Book,  in  1871,  by  a  committee  from 
the  Psi,  appointed  by  the  Grand  Chapter,  of  which  Bro.  J.  M.  Dodge 
was  the  efficient  chairman.  There  had  been  for  many  years  a  demand 
for  a  printed  collection  of  Zeta  Psi  songs.  Committee  after  committee 
had  been  appointed  by  successive  conventions  to  no  purpose,  until  the 
task  was  given  to  the  new  chapter  at  Cornell,  and  carried  by  them  to 
successful  conclusion. 

In  1874  the  question  as  to  the  advisability  of  establishing  a  chapter 
at  Syracuse  University  was  debated,  and  was  finally  referred  to  the  Psi 
for  investigation.  A  number  of  visits  to  Syracuse  were  made  by  mem- 
bers of  the  Psi,  and  the  Psi  Chapter  was  in  turn  visited  several  times 
by  the  petitioners.  Satisfied  that  the  conditions  were  favorable,  author- 
ity for  establishing  a  chapter  at  Syracuse  was  sought  and  obtained. 
The  petitioners  were  summoned  to  Ithaca,  and  there,  on  June  10,  1875, 
were  initiated  into  Zeta  Psi.  On  the  following  Monday  the  Gamma 
Chapter  was  duly  installed  at  Syracuse  as  the  representative  of  Zeta 
Psi  at  Syracuse  University. 


678  PSI  CHAPTER 

Bro.  W.  L.  Otis,  at  that  time  Alpha  Sigma  Alpha  of  the  fraternity, 
visited  the  Psi  in  October,  1874,  and  reported  the  chapter  in  excellent 
condition.  He  found  the  Brothers  housed  in  ten  or  twelve  leased  rooms  in 
the  Sprague  Block,  of  which  three  were  devoted  to  chapter  purposes,  the 
remainder  being-  used  as  private  bedrooms  and  studies  by  the  members. 
This  prosperity  continued  until  the  college  year,  1876-7,  when  the  chap- 
ter experienced  its  first  setback  in  the  loss  of  a  large  proportion  of 
its  active  members.  Bros.  B.  d'A.  Prado,  '76,  and  Calvin  Tomkins,  '79, 
were  the  only  members  who  returned  in  the  fall  of '77.  They  discussed 
the  situation  and  determined  that  earnest  endeavor  would  save  the 
chapter.  Messrs.  Mandeville,  Everson,  Buchman,  Gentleman  and  Bissell 
were  pledged  and  initiated;  others  were  added  to  the  number,  so  that 
by  the  end  of  the  fall  term,  there  were  fourteen  members  to  maintain 
Zeta  Psi's  position  at  Cornell. 

The  Psi  Chapter,  in  conjunction  with  the  Gamma,  entertained  the 
Grand  Chapter  at  its  thirty-fifth  annual  session  at  Syracuse,  on  January 

4  and    5,  1882.     Again,  in    1894,  the    Cornell  Chapter  had  the  honor  of 
entertaining  the  Grand  Chapter  at  the  convention  held  at  Ithaca,  January 

5  and  6,  1894.     In  June,  1881,  the  chapter  moved  into  a  house  at  the  cor- 
ner of  Buffalo  and  Tioga  Streets,  which  remained  the  home  of  the  Psi 
and  its  members  until  1886,  when  a  house  on  Eddy  Street  was  leased 
and  occupied  until  the  final  change  to   the  magnificent  new  chapter 
house  was  made  in  1892. 

Resolutions  were  adopted  on  May  23,  1879,  respecting-  the  establish- 
ing of  a  chapter-house  fund;  a  special  tax  of  four  dollars  per  annum  was 
levied  upon  each  Brother,  and  a  committee,  consisting  of  Bros.  Everson, 
Buchman  and  Gentleman,  was  appointed  to  take  charge  of  the  funds. 
The  next  important  step  in  the  movement  was  the  incorporation,  on  Octo- 
ber 28,  1889,  of  the  "  Psi  Chapter  House* Association,"  with  J.  Howard 
Ford,  President;  Willard  Gentleman,  Vice-President;  Albert  Buchman, 
Secretary;  and  Charles  B.  Everson,  Treasurer.  Bro.  Everson  had  for 
twelve  years  been  unceasing-  in  his  efforts  to  collect  money  for  the  fund, 
until,  in  1891,  the  sum,  collected  in  small  amounts  from  the  Brothers, 
was  considered  large  enough  to  warrant  the  trustees  in  undertaking" 
the  erection  of  the  house.  One  of  the  finest  pieces  of  property  in  Ithaca, 
situated  on  Stewart  Avenue,  adjoining-  Ithaca  Gorge,  with  a  frontage  of 
one  hundred  and  fifty  feet  and  a  depth  of  two  hundred  feet,  was  pur- 
chased. The  house  was  completed  in  1892.  It  is  one  of  the  most  costly 
and  beautiful  fraternity  houses  in  America,  and  is  a  just  sourceof  pride 
to  the  trustees,  whose  arduous  labors  and  skillful  financiering  provided 
the  funds  for  the  architect,  Bro.  Buchman,  whose  professional  skill  of 
a  high  order  was  incited  to  its  best  endeavor  by  the  love  he  bore  to  Zeta 
Psi,  to  the  chapter  whose  palatial  house  it  became,  and  to  the  fraternity 
whose  name  it  so  proudly  bears.  Since  the  occupation  of  its  new  home 
by  the  chapter,  the  Psi  has  maintained  its  high  standing  and  now  se- 
curely holds  a  leading  position  among  the  many  fraternities  at  Cornell. 

That  the  best  fraternity  men  are  the  best  college  men  is  a  principle 
which  the  Psi  has  always  endeavored  to  prove.  In  the  social  and  ath- 
letic activities  of  the  college  Zeta  Psi  has  had  its  due  share  of  honors,  and 
especially  in  aquatics  has  the  Psi  played  an  important  part  in  placing 
Cornell  in  her  present  position.  E.  L.  Phillips,  '76,  rowed  in  the  1875 
crew;  Camp,  '78,  was  on  the  victorious  Freshman  crew  in  1875;  Francis, 
'77,  won  in  1876  the  single-scull  race  and  still  holds  the  amateur  record 
in  single  sculls;  E.  H.  Cole,  '81,  and  A.  H.  Cowles,  '81,  were  both  in 
the  winning  crew  of  1879;  Schofield,  '84,  and  Swartwout,  '85,  were 
members  of  both  the  1884  and  1885  crews,  and  the  latter  was  stroke  of 
his  crew  in  1885;  Rowland,  '84,  won  the  single-scull  race  in  1885;  R. 
L.  McComb,  '91,  was  stroke  of  the  1888  boat,  and  Psotta,  '90,  won  sin- 
gle-scull races  in  1887,  1888  and  1889.  W.  B.  Stamford  was  on  '99  Fresh- 
man crew  and  the  '97  'varsity  squad. 

Lacking  in  completeness  would  be  a  history  of  the  Psi  Chapter  which 


PSI  CHAPTER  679 

failed  to  give  credit  to  the  Elders  of  the  chapter,  who  have  contributed 
not  only  to  their  own  chapter,  but  also  very  materially  to  the  prosperity 
of  the  fraternity  at  large.  The  Psi  has  furnished  many  Grand  Chapter 
Officers  and  has  had  representation  among  the  Grand  Officers  almost  con- 
tinuously since  1873,  the  only  exceptions  being  in  1886  and  1889.  Twice 
has  the  highest  office  in  the  fraternity  been  bestowed  on  Psi  men — Bro. 
Charles  B.  Everson,  '78,  was  elected  Phi  Alpha  in  1888,  and  Bro.  J. 
Howard  Ford,  '77,  was  elected  to  the  same  office  in  1894.  The  very 
important  office  of  Gamma  Alpha  has  been  held  continuously  by  Psi  men 
since  1873,  with  the  exception  of  the  four  years  from  1886  to  1890:  by  Bro. 
J.  H.  Buff  urn,  '75,  from  1873  to  1882;  Bro.  Charles  B.  Everson,  '78,  from 
1882  to  1886,  and  Bro.  Albert  Buchman,  '79,  from  1890  to  the  present  day. 
Bro.  Charles  B.  Everson  rendered  most  valuable  and  efficient  service  as 
chairman  of  the  committee  which  published  the  general  catalogue  of  the 
fraternity  in  1883.  He  was  always  an  enthusiastic  worker  for  Zeta  Psi, 
and  deservedly  ranks  among  the  very  first  of  the  most  prominent  and 
efficient  supporters  of  the  fraternity.  Bro.  J.  Howard  Ford  was  chair- 
man of  the  committee  which  published  the  Zeta  Psi  Directory  of  1893, 
and  is  chairman  of  the  committee  on  this  1899  Zeta  Psi  Biographical 
Catalogue.  Wise  in  council,  conservative  in  judgment,  enthusiastic  in 
Zeta  Psi  affairs  and  faithful  in  his  attendance  upon  fraternity  functions, 
he  has  for  a  number  of  years  exerted  a  potent  and  beneficial  influence, 
and  has  aided  materially  in  placing  Zeta  Psi  on  her  present  secure 
basis. 

Counseled  and  supported  by  such  Elders  as  Bros.  Ford,  Everson 
and  Buchman,  who  retain  active  control  of  the  chapter  house  and  who 
visit  the  chapter  regularly,  the  Psi  cannot  fail  to  retain  the  vantage 
ground  she  has  already  won  at  Cornell,  nor  to  raise  yet  higher  the  white 
banner  of  Zeta  Psi  on  the  heights  overlooking  the  beautiful  Cayuga.

HISTORY  OF  THE  IOTA  CHAPTER 

The  University  of  California  is  an  integral  part  of  the  public  educa- 
tional system  of  the  State  and  is  under  the  control  of  a  Board  of  Regents 
appointed  by  the  Governor  of  California.  It  was  founded  under  an  act 
of  the  Congress  of  the  United  States,  passed  in  1862.  It  received  a  large 
land-grant  and  subsidies,  and  still  receives  in  addition  a  yearly  in- 
come from  the  United  States.  The  charter  of  the  University  was  granted 
to  it  by  the  State  of  California  in  1868,  and  a  part  of  its  income  is  de- 
rived from  a  tax  of  two  cents  on  each  $100  of  the  taxable  wealth  of  the 
State,  which  income  is,  of  course,  constantly  increasing  in  amount.  In 
addition  to  these  two  sources  of  income  the  productive  funds  of  the  Univ- 
ersity amounted  to  nearly  $3,000,000.  For  the  first  few  years  work  was 
carried  on  in  Oakland  in  continuation  of  the  work  of  the  old  College  of 
California,  founded  in  1855.  In  1873  the  University  removed  to  its 
present  site  in  Berkeley.  The  site  comprises  245  acres  of  land  rising 
at  first  in  a  gentle,  and  then  in  a  bolder,  slope  from  a  height  of  about 
200  feet  above  the  sea-level  to  one  of  over  900  feet  in  altitude;  it  thus  covers 
a  range  of  more  than  700  feet  in  altitude,  while  back  of  it  the  chain  of 
hills  continues  to  rise  1,000  feet  higher.  It  has  a  superb  outlook  over 
the  Bay  and  City  of  San  Francisco,  over  the  neighboring  plains  and 
mountains  and  the  ocean.  An  extensive  scheme  of  rebuilding  has  been 
made  possible  through  the  liberality  of  Mrs.  Phebe  A.  Hearst,  widow  of  the 
late  United  States  Senator,  George  Hearst,  and  plans  are  well  under  way 
to  adorn  this  beautiful  site  with  a  group  of  new  buildings  in  harmonious 
accord  with  the  landscape  and  with  one  another.  In  addition  to  the 
professional  undergraduate  colleges  and  schools  the  University  includes 
the  Observatory  founded  by  James  Lick  in  1875,  with  an  endowment  of 
$700,000,  situated  at  Mt.  Hamilton  near  Santa  Clara,  California.  During 
the  past  ten  years  the  number  of  students  in  attendance  has  quadrupled; 
in  1899-1900  there  were  301  instructors  and  2,525  students. 

In  1870,  but  two  years  after  the  University  was  in  working  order, 
steps  were  taken  to  establish  a  chapter  of  Zeta  Psi  on  the  Pacific  Coast. 
The  Iota  Chapter,  the  first  chapter  of  Zeta  Psi  and  of  any  fraternity,  owes 
its  existence  to  the  enthusiasm  and  activity  of  several  members  of  the 
fraternity,  elders  of  Eastern  chapters,  then  living  in  the  far  "West.  Promi- 
nent among  these  elders  was  Charles  Allen  Sumner,  '54,  Zeta  Chap- 
ter. As  a  result  of  a  visit  East,  probably  made  in  1870,  and  of  con- 
sultations with  the  Grand  Officers  and  others  prominent  in  the  councils 
of  the  fraternity,  it  was  made  clear  that  the  Grand  Chapter  would  heart- 
ily endorse  the  proposition  to  establish,  under  favorable  conditions,  a 
chapter  of  Zeta  Psi  at  the  University  of  California,  then  located  at 
Oakland,  a  suburb  of  San  Francisco.  Sumner  enlisted  the  interest 
of  a  friend,  Brainerd  C.  Brown,  class  of  1870,  University  of  California, 
and  taking  advantage  of  a  visit  to  San  Francisco  of  Arthur  Bald  win  "War- 
ing, '70,  Phi  Chapter,  these  two,  about  June  10,  1870,  gathered  to- 
gether a  nucleus  from  which  was  to  spring  the  chapter.  In  gathering 
this  nucleus  and  holding  it  together,  Everett  Benedict  Pomeroy,  '71, 
Iota,  was  especially  active.  At  the  meeting  of  the  Grand  Chapter  at 
Philadelphia,  December  28-29,  1870,  the  establishment  of  the  new  chapter 
was  discussed,  petitions  and  letters  from  elders  on  the  Pacific  Coast  were 
presented,  and  the  Grand  Officers  were  authorized  to  proceed  with  the 
work  of  establishment,  which  was  soon  recognized  as  accomplished. 

But  little  was  done  for  a  number  of  months  after  the  first  gathering 
until  the  summer  of  1871,  when  a  visit  of  Albert  Beverly  Carlton,  '72,  Phi, 
to  California  stir  red  the  circle  into  activity.  He  broughtwith  him  the  spirit 
of  Zeta  Psi  fellowship,  and  by  his  ardent  enthusiasm  and  active  work  of 
instruction  did  much  to  lessen  the  handicap  under  which  the  members 


IOTA  CHAPTER 

of  the  new  chapter  were  laboring-through  their  isolation  from  other  chapters 
and  the  novelty  of  the  association.  At  the  next  Grand  Chapter  meeting-, 
held  at  Providence,  December  27-28,  1871,  Carlton  represented  the  new 
chapter  and  gave  an  account  of  the  visit  of  Waring-  to  California  and  of 
his  own  visit  and  the  circumstances  of  the  establishment. 

By  1872,  the  chapter  was  well  established,  with  representation  from 
all  the  classes  then  in  college.  From  the  very  start  the  qualifications 
for  membership  were  of  the  very  highest,  the  aim  being  to  gather  together 
into  closer  bonds  of  friendship  a  company  of  manly,  congenial  men  whose 
union  would  promote  zeal  in  study,  the  formation  of  warm  and  lifelong 
friendships,  and  whose  combined  influence  in  the  college  should  ever  be 
exerted  in  the  direction  of  progress. 

The  new  association  was  soon  recognized  as  a  force  in  the  college 
world.  Largely  through  its  activity,  the  Durant  Rhetorical  Society 
sprang  into  new  life,  the  University  Echo  was  originated,  the  University 
Dramatic  Society  was  organized,  and  the  University  Boat  Club  became 
a  reality.  Early  in  the  Iota  Chapter's  history  due  weight  was  given  to 
the  social  side  of  the  chapter  life;  annual  banquets  became  a  feature, 
enlisting  the  interests  of  the  elders  of  Eastern  chapters  living  in  and  near 
the  University  city.  In  connection  with  the  public  exercises  of  the 
"grand  annual"  the  Zetes  gave  several  small  select  balls. 

In  the  fall  of  1873  the  University  was  removed  to  Berkeley,  at  which 
time  the  chapter  secured  a  hall  and  a  home  for  its  members  in  the 
"Berkeley  Farm  House."  Here,  for  the  first  time,  the  members  were 
happily  associated  under  one  roof,  and  so  conducive  to  every  interest  of 
the  society  did  the  system  prove  that  a  chapter  house  has  been  maintained 
ever  since.  In  the  following  year  the  chapter  procured  the  commodious 
Humboldt  Hotel,  with  its  adjoining  beautiful  grounds,  at  Tenescal,  some 
distance  from  the  University  grounds  at  Berkeley,  and  here  they  were 
quartered  during  the  greater  part  of  the  college  year  1874-5.  During  this 
period  special  attention  was  given  to  the  literary  work  of  the  chapter, 
which  was  maintained  with  great  success  and  profit  to  the  members,  as 
evidenced  by  the  success  of  those  participating  in  the  college  prize  debates 
and  oratorical  contests. 

From  the  time  the  chapter  entered  upon  its  chapter-house  life  atten- 
tion had  been  called  to  the  desirability  of  securing  by  purchase  or  by 
building  a  house  adequate  to  its  needs.  Negotiations  for  the  purchase 
of  Humboldt  Hotel  having  failed,  the  chapter  moved  to  Berkeley  again, 
occupying  the  large  cottage  on  Dwight  Way,  which  was  furnished  very  ele- 
gantly, and  which  was  the  scene  of  many  successful  social  gather  ings  dur- 
ing the  brief  time  it  was  occupied.  During  the  summer  of  1876  the  present 
commodious  and  elegant  chapter  house  was  erected,  and  with  appropri- 
ate ceremonies  was  dedicated  to  the  use  of  Zeta  Psi  in  September  in  the 
presence  of  many  elders,  who  joined  in  the  congratulations  of  the  occa- 
sion. In  this  matter  the  chapter  lies  under  heavy  obligations  to  Brothers 
Hinton,  Dargie,  Van  Dyke,  Meek  and  Fairbanks. 

By  1878  four  or  five  fraternities  were  represented  at  the  University, 
and  Zeta  Psi,  with  the  others,  passed  safely  through  a  period  of  frater- 
nity opposition.  Commencing  with  the  antagonism  of  students,  which  for 
a  time  was  active  enough  to  find  expression  in  a  college  paper,  the 
Oestrus,  the  controversy  was  soon  carried  into  the  Board  of  Regents  and 
the  faculty.  On  commencement  day,  1879,  an  unofficial  communication 
was  received  by  the  chapter  from  the  President  of  the  University  stating 
that  during  the  summer  vacation  the  Regents  would  probably  adopt 
measures  leading  to  the  abolition  of  secret  societies  at  Berkeley.  At  the 
meeting  of  the  Regents  held  August  7th  formal  resolutions  to  secure  this 
end  were  adopted. 

Immediately  upon  the  opening  of  the  term  the  faculty,  after  having, 
through  a  special  committee,  considered  the  subject,  passed  a  decree  to 
pledge  all  entering  Freshmen  not  to  join  any  college  secret  society  dur- 
ing their  connection  with  the  University,  and  thus  prospects  for  the  life  of 


IOTA  CHAPTER  715 

the  Iota  looked  dismal.  It  is  well  to  note  in  this  connection  that  indi- 
vidual members  of  the  faculty  openly  testified  that  no  charges  were  pre- 
ferred against  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity,  but  that  the  faculty's  action  was 
made  mandatory  by  the  Regents.  Shortly  after  a  great  council  of  mem- 
bers of  the  fraternity  on  the  Coast  was  held  at  San  Francisco,  at  which 
it  was  resolved  to  contest  the  action  of  the  authorities  in  every  honorable 
way.  Subsequently  the  University  Alumni  Association  met  in  Oakland 
and  condemned  the  action  of  the  authorities  as  being  inimical  to  the  best 
interests  of  the  University.  Several  leading  newspapers  of  the  State 
took  a  similar  view  of  the  case;  a  petition  requesting  the  Regents  to 
reconsider  their  decision,  signed  by  many  prominent  citizens,  was  pre- 
sented. The  Regents  at  their  meeting  on  February  10,  1880,  rescinded 
their  resolution  of  August,  1879,  only  two  members  voting  the  contrary; 
the  faculty  likewise  withdrew  their  opposition,  and  a  crisis  in  the  his- 
tory of  fraternity  life  was  safely  passed.  The  fact  that  secret  societies 
exist  to-day  in  Berkeley  is  due  almost  entirely  to  the  efforts  of  the  Iota 
Chapter  of  Zeta  Psi. 

During  almost  thirty  years  of  activity  Zeta  Psi  has  enrolled 
through  the  Iota  Chapter  many  men  prominent  in  the  active  duties  of  life. 
Among  those  who  have  taken  a  prominent  part  in  educational  matters 
may  be  mentioned :  Professor  George  C.  Edwards,  Professor  "William 
Evelyn  Hopkins,  M.  D.,  Professor  Stanley  Stillman,  M.  D.,  Mr.  Joseph 
U.  Le  Conte  and  Mr.  J.  C.  Rowell,  all  of  the  faculty  of  the  University  of 
California,  and  Professor  John  M.  Stillman,  Vice-President  of  Leland 
Stanford,  Jr.,  University.  In  political  life  the  Iota  has  enrolled  Hon. 
James  H.  Budd,  ex-Governor  of  California,  Hon.  F.  W.  Henshaw,  Justice 
of  the  Supreme  Court  of  California,  John  E.  Budd,  Arthur  Rodgers  and 
Capt.  Geo.  J.  Ains worth,  deceased,  Regents  of  the  Universityof  California. 

The  chapter  has  had  a  vigorous  existence;  its  ranks  have  been  full; 
its  morale  high;  unanimity  has  characterized  its  proceedings;  firm  bonds 
of  friendship  and  brotherly  love  have  united  its  members.  It  has  never 
interfered  with  the  administration  of  the  University;  its  whole  influence 
has  been  wielded  for  the  advancement  of  the  institution.  Such  being  her 
traditions,  let  the  Iota  cling  to  them.  Let  wisdom  counsel,  prudence 
direct  and  courage  execute,  then  shall  eminent  success  be  gained.

HISTORY  OF  THE  GAMMA  CHAPTER 

(SYRACUSE) 

Syracuse  University  was  founded  in  1871,  although  as  the  outgrowth 
of  Genesee  College,  situated  at  Lima,  N.  Y.,  its  history  is  carried  back 
to  1851,  when  the  latter  institution  was  founded.  The  last  graduating 
class  of  Genesee  College  was  that  of  1870.  There  was  no  graduating  class 
in  1871,  most  of  the  students  holding  over  to  receive  their  degrees  with 
the  class  of  1872  from  Syracuse  University.  As  a  result  of  agitation  to 
remove  Genesee  College,  in  1866  active  measures  were  taken  to  found  a 
central  college  or  university  for  the  Methodism  of  New  York.  The  con- 
ferences of  Central  New  York  heartily  joined  in  the  work  of  providing 
ways  and  means,  and  the  city  of  Syracuse  offered  to  contribute  §100,000, 
providing  the  new  university  was  located  in  or  near  that  city.  At  a 
Methodist  State  convention  held  in  February,  1870,  at  Syracuse,  sub- 
scriptions towards  endowment  were  reported  as  amounting  to  S385,000; 
the  movement  was  enthusiastically  endorsed,  a  provisional  board  of  trus- 
tees was  elected  and  steps  taken  to  secure  a  charter.  The  charter  was 
received  from  the  Legislature  a  few  months  later,  a  site  was  chosen, 
grading  and  building  were  at  once  commenced,  and  the  College  of  Liberal 
Arts  of  the  new  university  opened  September  1,  1871,  with  an  attendance 
at  the  first  chapel  exercises  of  forty-one.  The  new  university  absorbed 
the  students  and  alumni  of  Genesee  College,  and  thus  started  with  a 
nucleus  which  rapidly  increased  in  numbers.  The  university  campus 
contains  fifty  acres,  beautifully  situated  in  the  city  of  Syracuse  upon  the 
heights  overlooking  Onondaga  Lake  and  Valley.  The  work  is  carried 
on  in  four  colleges,  namely,  Liberal  Arts,  Fine  Arts,  Medicine  and  Law. 
In  1899-1900  the  faculty  numbered  130,  the  students,  men  and  women,  1,250 
— about  one-half  of  whom  are  in  the  College  of  Liberal  Arts.  Rev.  James 
Roscoe  Day,  S.  D.  D.,  LL.  D.,  has  been  chancellor  since  1894. 

The  new  university  was  at  once  recognized  as  an  appropriate  field 
for  fraternity  extension,  so  that  by  1874,  when  the  first  steps  were  taken 
to  establish  a  chapter  of  Zeta  Psi,  three  fraternities  were  already  repre- 
sented with  chapters.  At  the  meeting  held  at  New  Brunswick,  N.  Y., 
October  22-23,  1874,  the  question  of  establishing  a  chapter  at  Syracuse 
was  first  brought  before  the  Grand  Chapter  by  a  petition  signed  by  mem- 
bers of  Syracuse  University  asking  for  a  charter.  A  committee  of  five, 
to  be  appointed  by  the  Psi  Chapter  at  Cornell  University,  was  authorized 
to  investigate  and  to  report  to  the  Grand  Officers  concerning  the  advisa- 
bility of  granting  such  a  petition.  Meanwhile  the  petitioners  at  Syracuse, 
in  order  to  hold  together— pending  the  consideration  of  their  request — 
formed  a  local  secret  society,  consisting  of  the  seven  men  who  were  subse- 
quently initiated  charter  members  of  the  new  chapter  of  Zeta  Psi.  The 
local  society  was  known  as  Theta  Chi  and  was  recognized  by  the  other 
fraternities  and  the  student  body. 

The  following  summary  of  the  proceedings  leading  to  the  founding 
of  the  chapter  is  taken  from  the  report  submitted  to  the  Grand  Chapter  at 
its  next  meeting  by  William  Lyman  Otis,  Sigma  Alpha:  "After  the  ad- 
journment of  the  last  convention,  upon  an  invitation  extended  by  the  Psi 
Chapter  (Cornell)  delegation,  Grand  Officers  Carneal,  Buffum  and  Otis 
proceeded  to  Ithaca,  N.  Y.  While  there  they  met  by  appointment  Mr.  F. 
Z.  Wilcox,  chairman  of  the  petitioners  for  a  chapter  of  Zeta  Psi  at  Syra- 
cuse University.  The  plan  and  conditions  of  establishing  a  chapter  were 
thoroughly  canvassed.  Later  in  the  fall  and  early  the  following  season 
the  Psi  Chapter,  to  whom  this  petition  had  been  referred  for  investigation, 
sent  to  Syracuse,  at  different  times,  several  committees  minutely  to  in- 
quire into  all  the  surroundings  and  prospects  of  success,  should  a  chapter 
be  granted.  The  Psi  Chapter  in  turn  was  also  visited  several  times  by  the 
petitioners.  In  May,  1875,  the  report  of  the  Psi  Chapter,  recommending 


744  GAMMA   CHAPTER   (SYRACUSE) 

the  petition,  was  submitted  to  the  Grand  Officers  and,  receiving  their  ap- 
proval, it  was  laid  before  the  chapters.  By  June  all  of  the  chapters  had 
reported  as  being"  in  favor  of  granting  the  petition;  this  fact  was  communi- 
cated to  the  Psi  Chapter  and  to  the  seven  petitioners  who  were  summoned 
to  Ithaca  and  then  and  there  initiated  into  the  fraternity,  June  11,  1875. 
On  the  following  Monday,  June  14,  William  Lyman  Otis,  Pi;  William 
Kelly  Simpson,  Psi,  and  Richard  Byron  Card  well,  Xi,  proceeded  to  Syra- 
cuse to  complete  the  work  of  founding  the  chapter.  Officers  were  elected 
and  installed,  full  explanations  of  the  workings  of  the  fraternity  were 
given,  and  the  Charge  was  delivered  to  the  Phi  of  this  new  chapter,  and 
also  to  the  chapter  itself,  by  the  officer  highest  in  rank  present." 

The  members  of  the  new  chapter,  which  was  called  the  Gamma, 
fortunate  in  coming  in  contact  with  so  loyal  a  Zete  as  William  Lyman 
Otis,  started  out  with  zeal  and  enthusiam  for  the  new  organization.  The 
men  initiated  as  charter  members  were:  Frank  Zioh  Wilcox,  '75,  Alpha 
Reeves  Beal,  '75,  Charles  Albert  Wall,  '76,  Jason  Parker,  '77,  Roswell 
Spencer  Price,  '76,  Wilbur  Fisk  Smallwood,  '78,  and  Vincent  Azariah 
Crandall,  '76.  To  these  were  added  one  week  later  John  Charles  Nichols, 
'75,  and  Orville  Allen  Merchant,  '77.  Upon  the  opening  of  the  fall 
term  other  additions  were  made,  and  at  the  Grand  Chapter  meeting  held  in 
Boston,  October  20-21, 1875,  its  first  delegate  reported  the  Gamma  as  well 
organized  with  ten  men  and  bright  prospects.  The  chapter  had  secured 
for  headquarters  the  entire  floor  of  a  building,  comprising  sleeping  rooms, 
parlor  and  hall  for  meetings  and  initiations. 

Some  opposition  was  at  first  experienced  from  the  other  societies  then 
represented  at  Syracuse,  but  this  was  evidently  not  disastrous,  for  by  the 
end  of  the  college  year  the  chapter  was  reported  as  being  in  excellent  con- 
dition, new  and  better  rooms  had  been  secured,  and  the  first  anniversary 
of  the  establishment  of  the  chapter  had  been  appropriately  celebrated  by 
a  reunion  and  banquet  of  elders  and  active  members.  The  chapter  was 
soon  recognized  as  ranking  with  the  chapters  of  the  two  other  leading 
fraternities  at  Syracuse.  With  the  aid  of  these  two  fraternities  the  Syra- 
cusan  was  established  and  published  for  a  number  of  years.  The  Zetes 
had  their  share  of  college  honors;  most  of  them  remained  in  college  until 
they  were  graduated.  The  membership  was  at  no  time  large.  The 
opening  of  the  college  year  in  the  fall  of  1876,  found  the  chapter  composed 
of  Sophomores.  Assisted  in  their  ' '  rushing ' '  by  Otis  and  Wallace  Brown, 
Psi,  they  soon  added  to  their  membership  six  good  men  from  the  Fresh- 
man class.  The  chapter  numbered  eleven  in  1876-7,  which  was  increased 
to  fifteen,  the  largest  membership  attained  the  following  year.  The 
Gamma  was  regularly  represented  at  the  Grand  Chapter  meetings,  and 
through  one  of  its  members,  D.  Cady  Gere,  took  an  active  part  in  its 
proceedings.  In  conjunction  with  the  Psi  Chapter  the  Grand  Chapter 
was  entertained  at  Syracuse  in  1882. 

The  years  following  1880  the  chapter  passed  through  some  trying 
ordeals.  Many  of  its  members  did  not  remain  in  college  long  enough 
to  be  graduated.  In  the  fall  of  1881  but  six  men  returned  and  notwith- 
standing the  initiation  of  seven  men  during  the  college  year  1881-2,  which 
brought  the  number  up  to  thirteen,  but  three  returned  in  the  fall  of  1882. 
This  number  was  increased  to  six  by  the  fall  initiations.  Again,  upon 
the  opening  of  college  in  the  fall  of  1884  but  three  returned  to  carry  on 
the  work  of  the  chapter.  Discouraged  by  small  membership  and  difficul- 
ties incident  thereto  the  chapter  never  recovered  from  these  years  of  trial. 
It  was  formally  suspended  by  action  of  the  Grand  Chapter  at  its  meet- 
ing held  in  New  York,  January  6-7,  1887. 

From  a  total  membership  of  fifty-two,  seven  of  whom  are  deceased, 
several  have  attained  prominence;  among  these  may  be  mentioned  Ben- 
jamin J.  Shove,  a  well-known  lawyer  of  Central  New  York,  recently 
engaged  in  the  prosecution  of  the  Canal  investigation,  and  A.  A.  God- 
ard,  at  present  Attorney-General  of  the  State  of  Kansas.

HISTORY  OF  THE  THETA  XI  CHAPTER 

The  Theta  Xi  Chapter  dates  its  birth  from  March  27,  1879,  for  on  that 
day  the  Bros.  John  A.  Green,  William  L.  Axford,  Charles  S.  Mitchell, 
W.  D.  Lowery,  Sam.  H.  DuShane,  R.  F.  Mull,  D.  F.  Kendall,  R. 
D.  Stephens,  from  our  mother  chapter,  the  £,  and  E.  M.  Izard,  and 
L.  Paddock,  of  the  II  Chapter,  assembled  under  the  leadership  of 
John  E.  Ensign,  then  A  2  A  of  the  fraternity,  for  the  purpose  of  insti- 
tuting this  chapter.  These  Brothers  held  a  meeting  in  the  residence  of 
University  College  in  order  to  initiate  certain  candidates.  Here  Bros. 
Clements,  Congdon,  Brock  and  Pattullo  first  learned  the  meaning  of  T 
K  $.  In  the  evening  another  meeting  was  held,  at  which  Douglas  Ar- 
mour, A.  B.  Shaw,  H.  K.  Woodruff,  H.  H.  Hull  and  W.  K.  McDougald 
were  initiated.  An  election  immediately  took  place,  at  which  the  fol- 
lowing Brothers  were  chosen  to  office  in  this  order:  Clements,  Congdon, 
Pattullo,  Brock,  Hull,  McDougald.  The  following  day  a  special  meet- 
ing was  held  and  this  chapter  was  started  on  its  career  under  the  name 
of  &  S.  So  Z  W  was  the  pioneer  fraternity  in  Canada  and  preceded  by 
thirteen  years  any  other  fraternity  there. 

The  first  cause  of  worry  to  the  new-born  chapter  was  the  rumor  that 
another  fraternity  was  about  to  establish  a  branch  at  the  University  of 
Toronto — a  contingency  which  did  not  happen  until  0  3,  had  found  its 
own  legs  and  stood  before  the  world  to  do  and  dare,  full  of  confidence 
and  pride,  and  strong  in  the  faith  which  has  made  and  still  animates 
Z  W.  The  Constitution  and  By-Laws  of  the  Fraternity  were  received  on 
the  27th  of  the  following  September,  during  the  Phiship  of  Bro.  Henry 
A.  Brock.  Unfortunately  Bros.  Clements,  Congdon,  Pattullo  and  Shaw 
had  been  graduated  before  the  Constitution  arrived,  but  they  were  able  to 
sign  it  subsequently,  thus  preventing  any  hiatus  in  the  role  of  0  3. 

From  this  time  the  chapter  began  to  fill  its  numbers  and  to  build  the 
strong  foundation  on  which  it  now  so  firmly  and  so  honorably  stands — a 
foundation  composed  of  men  who  have  subsequently  proved  themselves 
before  the  world,  and  in  its  trials  have  made  themselves  and  their  fra- 
ternity respected  among  their  peers.  The  first  lessons  now  learned  by  a 
new  Brother  are  the  principles  of  the  fraternity  and  a  love  and  respect 
for  those  who  labored  amidst  opposition  and  ill-feeling,  yet  always  true 
to  their  ideals  and  to  themselves,  till  they  had  placed  0  3  upon  a  rock 
of  safety  from  which  we,  who  like  Dumas'  Guardsmen  are  "all  for  one, 
and  one  for  all,"  have  sworn  it  shall  never  fall. 

The  new,  struggling  chapter  presented  a  spectacle  not  unlike  that  of 
the  first  settlers  of  a  new  country.  The  soil  wherein  they  were  to  sow 
was  unfavorable  and  the  other  natural  difficulties  were  great.  The  meet- 
ings at  first  were  conducted  in  absolute  secrecy,  even  the  place  of  meet- 
ing, the  rooms  in  college  of  one  or  other  of  the  Brothers,  was  unknown. 
The  members  of  the  fraternity  were  known  to  outsiders  only  from  the 
fact  of  their  associating  together.  Needless  to  say,  the  initiations  were 
carried  out  under  great  disadvantages  until  at  length  rooms  were  secured 
in  the  Grand  Opera  House  building.  But  0  2  found  herself  on  November 
29th  burned  out  of  house  and  home  and  once  more  forced  to  make  her 
habitation  in  the  rooms  of  some  Brother. 

Our  first  representative  at  a  convention  of  the  fraternity  was  Bro. 
Henry  A.  Brock,  at  Philadelphia,  in  1880.  The  chapter  by  this  time 
was  becoming  a  very  important  entity  in  University  life,  and  an  attempt 
was  made  by  the  Brothers  to  purchase  the  existing  University  paper, 
White  and  Blue.  On  March  17th,  1880,  the  chapter  lodged  itself  in  what 
were  known  as  "Club  Chambers,"  but  the  feeling  among  undergrad- 
uates was  very  strong  against  the  fraternity — so  much  so,  in  fact,  that 
it  was  decided  to  make  strenuous  efforts  to  conceal  the  names  of  the 


756  THETA  XI  CHAPTER 

Brothers,  and  regular  meetings  were  stopped.  By  the  end  of  April  the 
rooms  had  been  given  up  and  meetings  were  held  in  Residence.  Zetes 
now  had  full  control  of  the  '  Varsity,  the  present  college  paper,  which 
they  founded  and  for  a  long  time  maintained  wholly  by  their  own  efforts, 
after  buying  up  nearly  all  the  interests  in  it. 

In  1881  the  outlook  was  so  much  brighter  that  some  efforts  were  made 
to  secure  a  chapter  house,  efforts  which,  however,  were  not  successful; 
so  the  chapter  ensconced  itself  in  rooms  in  King  Street.  An  improvement 
was  noticed  in  fraternity  matters,  owing  principally  to  the  settled  life 
after  the  sort  of  Bohemian  existence  the  Brothers,  as  a  chapter,  had  led  for 
some  time.  One  very  interesting  event  occurred  this  year :  a  certain  lady 
was  making  strenuous  and  not  very  successful  efforts  to  obtain  recogni- 
tion as  a  proper  undergraduate  of  University  College  and  the  Zetes 
showed  themselves  as  a  body  in  backing  up  her  efforts  for  coeducation. 

The  following  year  was  most  successful.  The  control  over  the  man- 
agement and  publication  of  the  '  Varsity  was  fully  retained  and  this, 
through  the  splendid  reception  given  to  the  paper,  gave  the  members  of 
the  chapter  great  weight  and  power.  The  Zetes  held  most  offices  of 
influence  in  the  University  and  succeeded  in  forming  a  union  of  all  the 
students  in  Toronto  for  the  promoting  and  preserving  of  their  common 
interests,  guided  by  the  unseen  hand  of  the  chapter.  At  the  convention 
of  this  year,  held  at  Syracuse,  Bro.  Edgar  N.  Clements  was  2  A,  and 
the  chapter  was  represented  by  Bros.  Henry  A.  Brock,  Laurence  J. 
Clarke,  G.  G.  S.  Lindsey  and  G.  S.  Macdonald.  Bro.  Brock  reported 
strongly  in  favor  of  establishing  a  chapter  at  McGill  College. 

The  management  of  the  Z  W  Monthly  was  given  to  the  &  3  Chapter, 
but  unfortunately  Bro.  Brock  found  that  he  could  not  carry  it  through, 
and  in  his  report  at  the  time  of  his  resignation  as  editor  he  expressed  the 
opinion  "that  a  journal  should  be  published  in  the  centre  of  its 
constituency,  where  it  can  adapt  itself  to  the  majority  of  its  readers." 
Accordingly  the  charge  of  the  Monthly  was  handed  over  to  the  A 
Chapter.  The  most  interesting  occurrence  of  the  academic  year  was 
the  production  of  Sophocles'  Antigone,  which  was  due  almost  entirely 
to  the  efforts  and  talents  of  our  Brothers.  The  chapter  was  lodged  in 
new  rooms  and,  though  only  five  members  were  left  from  the  previous 
year,  the  circle  soon  contained  eleven  men,  who  congratulated  themselves 
on  being  the  happy  instruments  of  the  installation  of  the  A  W  Chapter, 
at  McGill. 

Our  representatives  at  the  convention  of  '83,  at  Boston,  were  Bros. 
A.  B.  Cameron  and  Henry  A.  Brock.  During  '84  the  chapter  had  to 
face  a  formidable  array  of  difficulties,  financial  and  otherwise,  but  the 
whole-souled  enthusiasm  of  the  actives  and  elders  carried  her  safely 
through,  and  at  the  convention  of  '85  her  representatives,  Bros.  H.  S. 
Osier  and  J.  McLean,  were  able  to  report  a  satisfactory  condition  of 
affairs.  The  very  important  step  of  regulating  the  eldership  and  its 
relation  to  the  active  chapter  was  taken  this  year.  The  plan  then 
adopted  has  well  stood  the  test  of  subsequent  experience,  and  has  proved 
a  means  of  binding  together  all  interests  of  the  chapter  into  a  homogene- 
ous whole.  In  June,  '87,  Q  S  mourned  the  loss  of  one  of  her  first  and 
best  Brothers,  Bartholomew  Bull  Pattullo,  '83. 

The  chapter,  as  a  representative  of  a  Greek  letter  Fraternity,  now 
incurred  a  great  deal  of  opposition  in  the  university.  A  circular  was 
published  by  the  anti-Zetes,  as  they  were  called,  purporting  to  give  the 
names  of  officers  and  members  of  the  chapter  and  the  purposes  of  the 
fraternity,  at  the  same  time  calling  upon  the  members  of  the  University  to 
stamp  it  out.  Needless  to  say,  this  monument  of  their  dislike  was  essen- 
tially illtimed  and  now  forms  one  of  the  interesting  relics  as  well  as 
indications  of  the  storms  through  which  &  S  has  passed. 

The  next  convention  was  held  in  Montreal  and  was  well  attended  by 
representatives  of  our  chapter.  In  January  a  library  was  started  to  be 
supplied  with  books  by  means  of  donations.  It  has  now  reached  a  fair 


THETA  XI  CHAPTER  757 

size.  During  this  same  year  Bro.  W.  E.  Colquhoun  died  just  before 
graduation.  This  was  the  first  death  which  has  occurred  in  the  active 
chapter,  and  the  Brothers  were  very  forcibly  brought  face  to  face  with  the 
uncertainty  of  this  life.  In  the  fall  the  chapter  made  its  headquarters  in 
new  rooms  in  Richmond  Street,  a  decided  step  towards  the  acquisition 
of  a  chapter  house,  which  had  long  been  the  goal  before  the  eyes  of 
the  Brothers. 

Bro.  Brock  very  kindly  donated  his  fraternity  pin  to  the  chapter,  and 
since  then  it  has  been  worn  by  every  £  of  the  chapter  during  his  term  of 
office.  The  history  of  this  pin  runs  concurrently  with  that  of  &  E,  as 
Bro.  Brock  was  one  of  the  first  members  of  the  chapter  and  the  first  #  but 
one,  and  consequently  its  possession  is  zealously  guarded  by  those  keep- 
ers of  the  chapter's  fortunes  who  are  now  honored  in  wearing  it.  This 
year  Bro.  W.  E.  Burritt  was  elected  A  2  A  at  the  convention  held  at 
New  York.  In  February,  University  College,  one  of  the  finest  exam- 
ples of  Norman  architecture  on  this  continent,  was  burned  to  the  ground 
on  the  night  of  the  annual  conversazione.  In  October,  Q  E  mourned  the 
loss  of  an  esteemed  Brother,  Oliver  Morphy. 

The  year  of  '91  was  one  of  the  most  successful  in  our  history.  Zetes 
occupied  nearly  all  the  offices  of  trust  and  honor  about  the  University, 
and  particularly  distinguished  themselves  in  the  domain  of  athletics. 
The  chapter  meetings  were  marked  by  the  unusually  good  quality  of  the 
debates  and  essays.  On  February  18  the  chapter  met  with  an  irrepara- 
ble loss  in  the  death  of  Bro.  George  Austin  Badgerow,  who  was  killed  by 
a  fall  from  his  horse.  Bro.  Badgerow  at  the  time  of  his  death  was  2  of 
the  chapter  and  a  lieutenant  of  "K"  Company,  Queen's  Own  Rifles  of 
Canada,  of  which  Bro.  Brock  was  then  captain  and  Bro.  Coleman  the 
other  lieutenant.  The  funeral  was  consequently  a  military  one.  Bro. 
R.  K.  Barker,  who  is  now  serving  as  captain  in  the  Royal  Canadian 
Regiment  in  South  Africa,  succeeded  him  as  second  lieutenant  of  this 
company,  which  was  made  up  entirely  of  university  students.  In  the 
following  month  the  fraternity  lost  a  good  Brother  and  true  through 
the  death  of  Bro.  G.  A.  Cameron,  whose  loss  was  sincerely  mourned  and 
deeply  felt.  Again,  in  October,  the  hand  of  death  removed  from  our 
midst  Bro.  J.  H.  A.  Procter. 

From  now  on  the  status  of  the  0  3  Chapter  was  well  established.  The 
older  among  our  elders  had  by  this  time  acquired  and  were  holding  offices 
of  trust  and  honor  in  every  walk  of  life,  and  gave  the  active  chapter  an 
admirable  support  in  every  way.  Their  probity  and  uprightness  went 
far  to  prove  to  the  world,  were  any  proof  needed,  the  moral  and  character- 
building  influences  of  the  bonds  of  T  K  $.  As  for  the  active  chapter,  it 
strove  well  and  faithfully  to  maintain  the  standard  of  excellence  set  by 
these  Zetes,  who  have  never  been  excelled  by  any  members  of  the  fra- 
ternity. Innumerable  offices  in  the  gift  of  the  student  body  were  filled 
by  our  men,  proving  beyond  a  doubt  the  estimation  in  which  they  were 
held  by  their  fellow  laborers  in  the  field  of  knowledge.  The  meetings 
were  particularly  successful,  and  the  enthusiasm  of  the  Brothers  fully 
compensated  for  the  competition  which  had  by  now  arisen,  namely,  the 
establishment  at  the  University  of  Toronto  of  chapters  of  two  other  fra- 
ternities. An  indication  of  the  chapter  feeling  is  gained  by  reference  to 
the  fact  that  over  70  members  were  present  at  the  annual  banquet  of  '93. 

In  '94  the  usual  quota  of  trophies,  in  the  way  of  distinctions  held  by 
the  Brothers,  hung  at  her  girdle;  and  the  chapter  was  at  last  in  a  posi- 
tion to  secure  a  long-sought  luxury,  a  chapter  house,  the  first  of  its  kind 
in  Toronto.  This  house  was  large  and  commodious  and  peculiarly  well 
suited  to  the  existing  needs  of  the  Brothers.  Naturally,  the  year  was 
spent  in  eager  and  yet  timid  waiting  for  the  coming  convention,  as  the 
Grand  Chapter  had  honored  us  by  accepting  our  invitation.  This 
convention  of  '95  remains  stamped  upon  the  records  as  a  gala  time  in 
our  history.  Representatives  were  present  from  every  chapter  except 
that  at  Leland  Stanford,  and  our  men  had  a  particularly  good  opportu- 


758  THETA  XI  CHAPTER 

nity  to  meet  many  Brother  Zetes.  The  usual  convention  programme  was 
carried  out;  a  feature  of  the  local  entertainment  being-  a  vaudeville 
or  music  hall  show,  given  by  our  chapter,  which  proved  excellent. 
Ice-boating-  and  the  usual  winter  sports  were  indulged  in.  Some 
of  them  were  quite  a  novelty  to  a  great  many  of  our  visitors.  Bro. 
Bristol  was  elected  $  A,  to  preside  over  the  convention  of  '96.  During 
the  night  of  the  banquet  the  restaurant  where  it  had  been  held  was 
burned  to  the  ground,  the  building  having  been  set  on  fire  by  sparks 
from  a  conflagration  on  the  next  block.  Fortunately  no  damage  was  done 
to  fraternity  property,  though  some  burning  sparks  were  carried  to  the 
roof  of  the  chapter  house,  but  were  extinguished.  The  thanks  of  &  3 
were  and  still  are  due  to  Bro.  W.  E.  Burritt,  on  whom  fell  the  responsi- 
bility of  the  convention.  He  has  labored  ceaselessly  in  the  interests  of 
the  fraternity  and  of  his  own  chapter,  and  is  to-day  one  of  those  whom 
it  delighteth  the  soul  of  ©  E  to  honor. 

In  the  spring  of  the  next  year  a  chapter  house  scheme  was  again 
mooted.  This  plan  lay  dormant,  with  periodic  awakenings,  until  active 
steps  were  taken  in  the  spring  of  '97.  During  this  year  the  Brothers 
mourned  the  loss  of  Bro.  Lyman  Aubery  Moore,  a  loss  severely  felt 
by  those  members  of  the  fraternity  who  had  the  good  fortune  to  know 
and  appreciate  him.  A  question  as  to  the  possibility  of  financing  the 
existing  home  of  the  chapter  was  brought  rather  prominently  forward. 
By  good  care  and  management  we  were  enabled  to  continue  in  our  old 
satisfactory  way.  A  fresh  competitive  element  sprang  up  in  the  found- 
ing of  a  chapter  of  a  fourth  fraternity  at  the  University.  In  this  winter 
death  removed  from  our  midst  a  much-beloved  and  much-lamented 
brother,  Bro.  J.  J.  Hughes. 

In  '97,  when  the  semi-centennial  session  of  the  Grand  Chapter  was 
held,  &  3  faced  the  serious  question  of  economy  with  a  view  to  acquire 
a  more  suitable  chapter  house  for  the  growing  needs  and  changing 
status  of  the  chapter.  The  result  was  a  decision  to  remain  in  statu  quo 
and  open  a  subscription  list  for  the  building  of  a  chapter  house  near  the 
University.  A  most  liberal  response  has  been  made  to  the  chapter's 
request  in  this  regard  and  the  fund  is  steadily  growing.  Another  seri- 
ous question  was  brought  before  us  this  same  year.  Owing  to  the 
enterprise  of  a  number  of  students  of  the  University  in  getting  out  a 
Year  Book,  as  is  done  in  the  American  colleges,  a  discussion  arose  as 
to  whether  our  chapter  should  appear  therein.  However,  it  was  decided 
to  take  no  part  in  it. 

Early  in  '98  occurred  the  sad  death  of  Bro.  Elmer  Lee  Robinson, 
one  time  $,  who  had  contracted  phthisis  during  his  university  course 
and  died  about  a  year  after  graduation.  Bro.  Robinson  was  one  of 
those  who  stand  out  preeminent  in  their  good  works  in  the  interest  of 
the  fraternity,  and  in  his  death  the  fraternity  lost  a  whole-souled 
Brother,  and  our  &  3  a  friend  who  was  more  than  Brother  to  those  who 
were  associated  with  him. 

In  the  fall  of  the  present  year  we  moved  into  a  chapter  house  which 
is  also  a  residence  for  the  Brothers.  At  present,  our  "  increasing  pur- 
pose runs"  to  the  building  of  a  sort  of  lodge  apart  from  the  chapter 
house,  which  will  be  used  entirely  and  exclusively  as  a  pi  ace  of  meeting. 
The  thanks  of  the  chapter  are  due  to  the  university  authorities,  who 
have  done  all  in  their  power  to  further  our  efforts  by  offering  us  a  lease 
of  University  property  upon  most  favorable  terms.  On  October  29th  we 
bade  good-bye  to  Bro.  R.  K.  Barker,  who  left  with  the  2d  Battalion  Royal 
Canadian  Regiment  to  join  the  field  force  for  service  in  South  Africa. 
Bro.  Barker  is  captain  of  C  Company  of  this  Battalion,  and  Q  S  feels 
that  her  prestige  is  perfectly  safe  in  his  hands. 

The  elders  of  this  chapter  have  lately  organized  a  literary  club, 
which  meets  monthly  at  the  chapter  house  for  the  purpose  of  reading  and 
discussing  original  papers.  The  first  paper,  read  by  Bro.  O.  P.  Edgar, 
was  a  "Comparison  of  the  Nature  Poetry  of  Keats  and  Shelley."  As 


THETA  XI  CHAPTER  759 

there  is  a  great  deal  of  good  talent,  these  papers  promise  to  be  of  un- 
usual interest  and  benefit. 

The  present  active  chapter  which  is  strong,  vigorous,  and  imbued 
with  love  and  reverence  for  Z  ^and  a  wholesome  appreciation  of  its  prin- 
ciples and  the  benefits  to  be  derived  therefrom,  cannot  but  labor,  as  its 
predecessors  have  done,  to  make  the  bonds  of  T  K  $  a.  living  reality  and 
to  maintain  0  £  in  that  place  among  the  chapters  of  our  fraternity 
which  has  been  won  for  her  by  years  of  devotion,  faith  and  esprit- 
de-corps.  We  may,  perhaps,  be  pardoned  for  a  very  natural  and 
sincere  laudation  of  those  Brothers  who  have  made  our  chapter  what  it 
now  is.  We  glory  in  the  difficulties  through  which  they  have  brought 
her,  and  find  in  the  "vires  acquirit  eundo"  an  augury  for  still  greater 
success  in  the  future. 

OurBrothersare  now  scattered  abroad  over  this  continent  and  beyond. 
Bros.  W.  E.  Burritt,  C.  S.  Cameron  and  E.  S.  Senkler,  recently  ap- 
pointed gold  commissioners  for  the  Yukon,  are  in  the  Klondike.  Several 
Brothers  now  live  in  Vancouver,  and  thence  Eastward  there  is  a  string 
of  men  who  represent  this  chapter.  Bro.  Lewellys  Barker  has  been  ap- 
pointed by  the  Johns  Hopkins  University  a  member  of  the  commission 
to  examine  into  and  report  upon  tropical  diseases  in  the  Philippines. 
Bro.  Leacock  is  at  the  University  of  Chicago.  Bro.  Tom  McCrae  is  at 
Johns  Hopkins.  Bro.  D.  J.  Armour  is  Assistant  Demonstrator  of  Anat- 
omy at  University  College,  London,  Eng.  Bro.  R.  K.  Barker,  Bro.  J. 
McCrae  and  Bro.  W.  J.  Laidlaw  are  now  on  active  service  in  the  Boer 
war.  The  following  honors  were  also  bestowed  upon  our  chapter  by  the 
fraternity  itself  in  electing  to  office  in  the  Grand  Chapter  these  Brothers: 
$  A,  Bro.  Edmund  J.  Bristol;  2  A,  Bro.  Henry  A.  Brock;  2  A,  Bro. 
Edward  N.  Clements;  2  A,  Bro.  Henry  A.  Fairbank;  A  2  A,  Bro. 
William  E.  Burritt,  who  has  been  for  several  years,  and  is  now,  a  mem- 
ber of  the  Committee  of  Patriarchs. 

In  conclusion,  Theta  Xi  promises  the  Grand  Chapter  the  same 
enthusiasm  and  devotion  she  has  always  shown.

HISTORY  OF  THE  ALPHA  CHAPTER 

Greek-letter  fraternities  have  for  many  years  occupied  an  interest- 
ing and  important  position  at  Columbia.  Until  Columbia  became  a 
full-fledged  University  and  moved  to  its  present  magnificent  site  on 
Morningside  Heights,  the  authorities  had  consistently  refrained  from 
encouraging  development  of  the  dormitory  system.  Fraternities  then  be- 
came almost  a  necessity  in  the  life  of  the  college,  for,  lacking  oppor- 
tunities for  the  cultivation  of  college  spirit,  the  close  and  intimate 
association  afforded  through  the  medium  of  the  fraternities,  was  almost 
the  only  means  available  for  the  development  of  the  social  side  of  college 
activity  at  Columbia. 

At  the  time  the  Alpha  was  established,  this  fact  began  to  be  more 
particularly  appreciated.  For  many  years  there  had  been  only  four 
fraternities  in  the  college,  and  they  were  among  the  best.  The  field, 
therefore,  was  well  chosen  for  a  chapter  of  Zeta  Psi,  and  her  example 
was  immediately  followed  by  many  of  the  other  fraternities. 

It  was  at  this  time  that  two  men  who  had  been  intimate  for  years 
came  together  to  open  the  way  for  Zeta  Psi  at  Columbia.  They  were 
Richard  Amerman  Anthony,  of  the  class  of  1881  in  the  academic  depart- 
ment, and  Walter  G.  Eliot,  then  a  post  graduate  in  the  Columbia  School 
of  Mines.  Anthony,  whose  father  and  uncle  were  Columbia  Alumni, 
had  been  a  sophomore  at  Rutgers,  but  left  that  institution  and  joined  the 
corresponding  class  at  Columbia.  He  had  become  a  member  of  Zeta 
Psi  while  at  Rutgers.  Being  a  natural  leader,  with  the  courage  of  his 
convictions,  he  decided  to  carry  his  fraternity  with  him  to  Columbia, 
rather  than  lose  active  connection  with  it;  and  to  him  is  due  the  honor 
of  originating  the  idea  of  a  chapter  at  Columbia  and  of  performing  the 
necessary  labor  incident  to  the  founding  of  this  chapter;  Eliot  worked 
with  him  heartily  to  make  the  enterprise  a  success,  and  gave  manyyears 
of  zealous  and  ceaseless  devotion  to  this  end. 

Anthony  found  that  a  number  of  Zetes  from  other  colleges  were 
attending  different  departments  of  Columbia.  He  called  them  together 
and  a  meeting  was  held  on  Saturday  evening,  November  1,  1879,  at  the 
Rossmore  (later  Metropole)  Hotel,  Broadway  and  42d  Street.  The 
matter  of  the  formation  of  a  chapter  of  Zeta  Psi  was  discussed  at  great 
length,  a  favoring  resolution  passed,  and  a  committee  appointed  to  pre- 
pare a  proper  petition  to  the  Grand  Chapter  and  to  secure  from  Zetes 
resident  in  New  York  the  requisite  endorsement. 

A  petition  dated  November  20,  1879,  was  accordingly  prepared  and 
signed  by  many  Zetes  prominent  in  the  city.  This  petition  was  duly 
forwarded  to  "William  Lyman  Otis,  at  Cleveland,  Ohio,  the  acting  head 
of  the  fraternity,  and  the  request  of  the  petitioners  was  granted  on  December 
4,  1879,  and  the  date  for  the  establishment  of  the  chapter  was  set  for 
December  12,  1879.  A  committee  of  five  to  arrange  the  details  for  the 
inauguration  of  the  new  chapter  was  appointed  consisting  of  Bros. 
J.  H.  Buffum,  Psi,  chairman;  C.  H.  Tillinghaste,  Theta;  Max  Schwerin, 
Jr.,  Theta;  J.  S.  R.  Kennedy  and  Richard  A.  Anthony. 

Two  meetings  of  the  committee  were  held,  one  on  Tuesday,  December 
9,  and  the  other  on  December  11,  1879;  invitations  were  extended  to  the 
Sigma,  Omicron,  Delta  and  Tau  Chapters,  and  to  a  large  number  of 
Elders  resident  in  and  about  New  York  City,  to  attend  on  the  occasion 
of  the  installation  of  the  chapter.  On  the  evening  of  December  12,  1879, 
at  the  Sturtevant  House,  Broadway,  the  ceremony  took  place,  Bro. 
William  Lyman  Otis  presiding  over  the  large  gathering  of  representative 
Zetes.  John  Fletcher  Duffield,  of  the  Medical  School,  was  the  first  man 
to  be  initiated  as  a  member  of  the  new  chapter. 


784  ALPHA  CHAPTER 

The  chapter  letter  "Mu"  was  given  to  the  new  chapter;  this,  how- 
ever, was  changed  to  "Alpha"  by  permission  of  the  Grand  Chapter 
Convention  held  in  January,  1882. 

Immediately  after  the  installation  ceremonies,  the  new  chapter  held 
its  first  meeting,  and  elected  as  officers  for  1879-80,  Kennedy,  Parmly, 
Simpson,  Anthony  and  Culver. 

Much  preliminary  work  was  done  before  the  second  meeting  was 
held  at  the  Rossmore  Hotel  on  February  14,  1880.  On  that  date  Eliot 
was  initiated,  and  thereafter  the  work  for  the  chapter  in  procuring  a 
place  for  itself  in  the  under-graduate  departments  devolved  upon  him 
and  upon  Anthony.  Their  success  in  the  face  of  strong  opposition  to  new 
organizations  manifested  by  the  existing  fraternities,  was  due  largely 
to  the  fact  that  membership  in  Zeta  Psi  was  kept  secret  for  nearly  two 
years,  while  the  chapter  was  firmly  establishing  itself;  thus  enabling 
it,  when  its  existence  finally  became  publicly  known,  to  take  immediately 
its  proper  place  among  the  other  fraternities. 

The  first  regular  home  of  the  chapter  was  at  No.  1481  Broadway;  it 
remained  there,  however,  only  a  short  time,  removing  within  a  few 
months  to  better  quarters  at  No.  927  Broadway. 

The  first  systematic  by-laws  of  the  chapter  were  adopted  on  May  6, 
1881. 

By  the  autumn  of  1882  the  chapter  had  again  outgrown  its  quarters, 
and  moved  to  104  "W.  42d  Street,  nearer  the  college,  and  after  a  year  in 
these  quarters,  to  No.  17  W.  42d  Street,  on  October  20,  1883.  In  this 
house,  and  in  the  adjoining  one,  No.  15,  it  remained  until  the  Zeta  Club 
was  established  at  24  E.  35th  Street,  and  there  the  chapter  was  given 
quarters,  the  first  meeting  there  being  held  on  October  30,  1886.  When 
the  club  moved  to  a  larger  house  at  No.  8  W.  29th  Street,  the  chapter 
followed,  as  also  to  the  other  houses  subsequently  occupied  by  the  club 
at  No.  44  W.  32d  Street,  and  No.  148  W.  34th  Street. 

In  the  fall  of  1892  it  left  the  club  and  took  quarters  by  itself  at  No. 
16  E.  42d  Street,  whence  it  moved  in  the  spring  of  1893  to  No.  394  Fifth 
Avenue,  where  it  remained  until  October,  1897,  at  which  time,  the 
necessity  of  being  near  the  University,  which  had  moved  to  Morningside 
Heights,  led  the  members  to  lease  a  house  from  October,  1897,  to  May, 
1899,  at  No.  238  W.  123d  Street.  In  October,  1899,  a  large  apartment, 
overlooking  the  college  grounds,  at  No.  417  W.  118th  Street,  was  taken 
by  the  chapter,  and  there  it  remains  during  the  work  preliminary  to  the 
building  of  its  own  permanent  chapter  house  on  Morningside  Heights. 

Many  Alpha  men  took  prominent  part  in  college  matters  during  their 
day,  and  a  number  have  attained  high  office  in  the  Grand  Chapter  of  the 
fraternity;  some  to-day  serve  among  Columbia's  instructors,  and  many 
are  known  prominently  in  the  business,  professional  and  political  life 
of  New  York  and  vicinity. 

The  Alpha  took  prominent  part  in  the  reestablishment  of  the  Rho 
Chapter  at  Harvard  in  1882,  the  Epsilon  at  Brown  University  in  1886, 
and  the  Eta  at  Yale  in  1889,  and  was  largely  instrumental  in  estab- 
lishing the  Zeta  Psi  Club  in  New  York  City. 

The  close  of  1899  completes  the  twentieth  year  of  the  existence  of 
the  chapter.  Like  most  social  organizations,  the  career  of  the  Alpha 
has  not  been  uncheckered;  but  the  earnestness  and  devotion  of  its  mem- 
bers have  always  served  to  tide  over  periods  of  temporary  depression.  All 
loyal  Alpha  men  feel  that  its  first  twenty  years  foreshadow  only  faintly 
its  future  prosperity  in  the  great  metropolitan  University;  may  each  re- 
member Emerson's  significant  words,  "No  man  is  truly  great  or  famous 
who  does  not  make  famous  every  institution  he  touches."

McGill  University,  which  was  founded  under  the  bequest  of  the  Hon. 
James  McGill,  became  a  University  by  a  Royal  Charter  in  1821,  and  was 
reorganized  by  an  amended  charter  in  1852.  In  1829  the  Montreal  School 
of  Medicine  was  incorporated  as  the  Medical  Faculty,  and  for  many 
years  McGill  was  known  outside  the  city  of  Montreal  chiefly  as  a  Medi- 
cal College.  Subsequently  the  Faculties  of  Law,  Applied  Science  and 
Veterinary  Medicine  were  added.  Owing-  to  generous  gifts  made  by 
certain  of  Montreal's  wealthy  citizens,  the  progress  during  the  last 
decade  in  all  the  departments  has  been  extraordinary.  There  are  at 
present  1,056  students  attending  lectures,  while  there  were  but  399  in 
1883,  when  the  Alpha  Psi  Chapter  was  founded. 

The  first  trace  of  any  attempt  on  the  part  of  the  fraternity  to  found 
a  chapter  of  Zeta  Psi  at  McGill  University  was  a  petition  brought  forward 
by  the  Theta  Xi  Chapter  of  Toronto  University  (then  established  one 
year),  before  the  Thirty-third  Annual  Convention  held  at  Philadelphia, 
in  January,  1880.  The  minutes  of  that  meeting  state  "that  the  Theta  Xi 
Chapter  urge  their  view  on  the  grounds  that  McGill  University  was  the 
largest  and  most  generously  endowed  university  in  Canada,  and  having 
no  rivals  in  the  field,  the  fraternity  would  have  no  trouble  in  starting 
such  a  chapter.  The  Theta  Xi  Chapter  was  authorized  to  appoint  a 
committee  from  their  own  chapter  thoroughly  to  examine  into  the  matter, 
and  report  at  the  next  Convention. ' ' 

The  attempts  of  the  Theta  Xi  Chapter  reached  no  practical  results, 
owing  chiefly  to  the  lack  of  communication  between  Toronto  University 
and  McGill,  until  Robert  Fulford  Ruttan,  a  graduate  of  Toronto,  went 
to  McGill  to  pursue  his  studies  in  the  Medical  Faculty.  Mr.  Ruttan, 
though  not  a  member  of  the  Theta  Xi  Chapter,  was  thoroughly  conversant 
with  the  aims  and  principles  of  the  fraternity  and  was  intimate  with  the 
members  of  the  Toronto  chapter.  He  was  on  that  account  entrusted  with 
the  task  of  carrying  out  the  project,  the  feasibility  of  which  had  been 
discussed  in  the  Thirty-fourth  and  Thirty-fifth  Conventions  of  the 
fraternity. 

At  the  beginning-  of  his  second  year  in  McGill,  Mr.  Ruttan  was 
joined  by  David  James  Gibb  Wishart,  a  graduate  of  Toronto  University 
and  a  member  of  the  Theta  Xi  Chapter.  These  gentlemen  at  once  took 
active  steps  towards  establishing  a  chapter,  and  having  selected  from 
among  their  associates  in  the  college  men  who  would  enter  into  the 
scheme  with  enthusiasm,  sent  a  formal  petition  to  the  Grand  Chapter 
requesting  that  the  chapter  should  forthwith  be  established.  The  peti- 
tion was  signed  by  :  David  James  Gibb  Wishart,  Med.  '85;  Robert  Ful- 
ford Ruttan,  Med.  '84;  Charles  Ernest  Cameron,  Med.  '83;  Wyatt  Gait 
Johnston,  Med.  '84;  Charles  Ernest  Gooding,  Med.  '84;  Jacques  Herbert 
Darey,  Med.  '85;  Alexander  Bryson  Osborne,  Med.  '86;  William  George 
Henry,  Med.  '83;  John  Henry  Young  Grant,  Med.  '86. 

No  time  was  lost  in  carrying  out  the  necessary  formalities  and  al- 
though the  petition  was  not  presented  until  early  in  December,  1882, 
thanks  to  the  zeal  and  energy  of  Bro.  D.  Cady  Gere,  A  2  A,  of  the 
Gamma,  and  Bro.  Henry  Brock  (editor  of  the  Z  W  Monthly),  of  the  Theta 
Xi,  the  vote  of  all  the  chapters  was  obtained  sufficiently  early  to  allow 
the  Alpha  Psi  Chapter  to  be  represented  at  the  Thirty-sixth  Annual 
Convention.  As  the  Grand  Officers  were  unable  to  go  to  Montreal, 
Bro.  Brock  obtained  the  consent  of  the  $  A  to  found  the  chapter  in  his 
name  and  with  Bro.  A.  B.  Cameron,  £,  of  the  Theta  Xi  Chapter,  arrived 
on  the  morning  of  the  3d  of  January,  1883.  In  the  afternoon  they  pro- 
ceeded to  initiate  Ruttan,  Cameron,  Osborne,  Johnston  and  Gooding. 
The  chapter  then  elected  Cameron,  £,  for  the  year,  and  chose  Cameron 


806  ALPHA  PSI  CHAPTER 

and  Ruttan  to  represent  them  at  the  Convention  of  the  Grand  Chapter 
at  Boston,  on  January  4th.  The  mileage  was  promptly  subscribed,  and 
the  delegates  boarded  the  train  at  7  P.  M.  Next  day,  when  the  chapter 
roll-call  brought  Cameron  forward  to  respond  for  Alpha  Psi,  the  hall 
rang  with  the  welcome  accorded  to  the  new  chapter. 

The  first  regular  meeting  of  the  chapter  was  held  on  the  following 
Saturday,  January  6th.  In  addition  to  the  charter  members,  there  were 
initiated  during  the  session,  L.  D.  Ross,  Med.  '84;  A.  W.  Clements, 
Vet.  '83;  J.  L.  Hague,  Med.  '84;  Guy  F.  Palmer,  Med.  '85;  J.  M.  Elder, 
Med.  '85,  and  J.  J.  Gardner,  Med.  '83.  The  chapter  room,  an  office  at 
214  St.  James  Street,  was  small  but  comfortable.  The  business  of  the 
meetings  was  regularly  and  enthusiastically  carried  on,  and  schemes 
for  future  greatness  were  freely  discussed.  During  the  following  sum- 
mer informal  meetings  were  held  at  the  rooms  of  the  different  Brothers, 
but  before  the  session  began,  the  chapter  had  rented  a  large  hall,  with 
convenient  anterooms,  on  the  N.  W.  cornerof  Mansfield  and  St.  Catherine 
Streets.  Having  become  firmly  established,  the  chapter  entered  upon  a 
career  of  continuous  prosperity.  The  number  nearly  always  reached 
the  limit  allowed  by  the  Grand  Chapter,  and  the  fact  that  Zeta  Psi  was 
for  fourteen  years  the  only  fraternity  in  the  University  afforded  its 
members  every  opportunity  for  making  a  careful  selection  of  their  associ- 
ates. One  hundred  and  fifty-six  men  have  been  initiated,  and  four  have 
been  enrolled  from  the  Theta  Xi  Chapter,  making  a  total  of  one  hundred 
and  sixty  members.  Of  these,  ninety-five  were  students  in  the  Faculty 
of  Medicine,  twenty -one  in  the  Faculty  of  Arts,  twenty-four  in  the  Faculty 
of  Applied  Science,  eighteen  in  the  Faculty  of  Law,  and  two  in  the 
Faculty  of  Veterinary  Medicine.  One  hundred  and  seventeen  have  taken 
degrees,  three  have  died,  nine  have  left  the  University  before  the  com- 
pletion of  the  course,  and  thirty-one  are  now  attending  college. 

Scholarship  has  been  of  a  high  order  in  the  chapter,  and  names  of 
Brothers  have  appeared  on  nearly  all  the  honor  lists.  Among  the 
highest  prizes  won  by  individual  members  are:  the  "Holmes"  gold 
medal  (awarded  to  the  student  of  the  graduating  class  who  receives  the 
highest  aggregate  number  of  marks  in  the  different  branches  comprised 
in  the  Medical  Curriculum),  won  in  1883,  by  C.  E.  Cameron;  in  1886,  by 
H.  S.  Birkett,  and  in  1891,  by  W.  A.  Brown.  The  "Sutherland"  medal 
(awarded  for  the  best  examination  in  General  and  Medical  Chemistry), 
was  won  in  1883,  by  R.  F.  Ruttan;  in  1884,  by  J.  M.  Elder;  in  1885, 
by  H.  A.  Lafleur,  and  in  1886,  by  W.  I.  Bradley.  The  "Shakspere"  gold 
medal  (awarded  to  the  student  who  takes  the  highest  honors  in  English 
Language,  Literature  and  European  History  in  the  B.  A.  examinations) 
was  won  in  1887,  by  C.  W.  Colby,  and  in  1897,  by  S.  C.  Archibald. 
The  "  Governor-General's"  medal  (awarded  for  graduate  Research 
Work  in  the  Faculty  of  Applied  Science)  was  awarded  in  1888,  to  A. 
L.  Drummond.  In  1895,  the  "British  Association"  medal  (awarded  to 
the  student  taking  the  highest  position  in  the  final  examinations  in  the 
Faculty  of  Applied  Science)  and  the  Science  Scholarship,  granted  by 
Her  Majesty's  Commission  for  the  Exhibition  of  1851  (to  enable  students 
to  continue  the  prosecution  of  Science  with  the  view  of  aiding  in  its 
advance  or  in  its  application  to  the  industries  of  the  country),  were  won 
by  R.  O.  King. 

Many  teaching  appointments  in  their  Alma  Mater  are  held  by  the 
elders.  Among  these  are  :  R.  F.  Ruttan,  M.  D.  '84,  Fellow  of  the 
Royal  Society  of  Canada,  professor  of  Practical  Chemistry,  Registrarof 
the  Medical  Faculty,  and  Elective  Fellow  in  the  Faculty  of  Medicine; 
H.  S.  Birkett,  M.  D.  '86,  professor  of  Laryngology;  C.  W.  Colby,  B.  A. 
'87,  Ph.  D.  (Harvard),  professor  of  History;  F.  G.  Finley,  M.  D.  '85,  M. 
D.  (London),  and  H.  A.  Lafleur,  M.  D.  '87,  assistant  professors  of  Medi- 
cine and  associate  professors  of  Clinical  Medicine;  Wyatt  G.  Johnston, 
M.  D.  '84,  assistant  professor  in  Public  Health  and  Preventive  Medicine; 
C.  F.  Martin,  M.  D.  '92,  assistant  professor  of  Medicine  and  Clinical

Medicine;  and  twelve  others  who  are  Lecturers,  Instructors  or  Demon- 
strators, nine  being  in  the  Medical,  one  in  the  Arts,  one  in  the  Law,  and 
one  in  the  Science  Faculties.  In  the  Montreal  General  Hospital,  at  the 
present  time,  the  Alpha  Psi  Chapter  is  represented  by  nine  members  of 
the  permanent  Attending  staff,  the  Medical  Superintendent,  and  one  of 
the  resident  House  staff.  In  the  Royal  Victoria  Hospital  there  are  three 
on  the  Attending  staff. 

Alpha  Psi  has  always  taken  a  high  stand  in  the  various  matters  of 
University  interest,  and  has  had  her  full  share  of  college  honors,  in 
spite  of  the  anti-fraternity  feeling,  which,  at  one  time,  was  intensely 
bitter.  The  history  of  athletics  in  McGill  centers  round  Rugby  football, 
and  the  ambition  of  every  student  who  aspires  to  athletic  honors  is  a 
place  on  the  First  XV.  The  chapter  has  contributed,  on  an  average,  one- 
third  of  the  team  each  year,  and  the  captain  on  eight  occasions.  They 
were:  J.  M.  Elder,  Med.  '85,  in  1884;  A.  E.  J.  Macdonell,  Med.  '88,  in 
1886  and  1887;  G.  W.  MacDougall,  Law  '94,  in  1892;  C.  D.  Gaudet,  Law 
'95,  in  1893;  H.  R.  Trenholme,  Sc.  '96,  in  1895;  H.  J.  Schwartz,  Med. 
'98,  in  1896;  and  Shirley  Davidson,  Sc.  '97,  in  1897. 

McGill  has  never  had  a  thoroughly  representative  team  playing  the 
great  Canadian  winter  game  of  hockey,  though  Shirley  Davidson,  Sc. 
'97,  Graham  Drinkwater,  Sc.  '97,  and  Campbell  Davidson,  Med.  '97, 
have  been  the  star  players  on  the  Championship  of  Canada  team.  At 
lawn  tennis  some  of  the  records  which  have  fallen  to  Alpha  Psi  are, 
that  in  1887,  C.  W.  Colby,  Arts  '87,  held  the  highest  score  for  singles,  and 
during  the  following  five  seasons  Charles  Martin,  Arts  '88  and  Med. 
'92,  defeated  all  comers.  In  the  International  intercollegiate  cricket 
match  played  at  Manheim,  Pa.,  on  July  6,  7,  8,  1899,  four  Brothers  from 
Theta  Xi  and  A.  and  J.  Glassco,  of  Alpha  Psi,  played  for  Canada,  the 
latter  of  whom  obtained  the  highest  batting  and  bowling  averages. 

All  the  various  branches  of  athletics  are  combined  under  the  juris- 
diction of  the  "McGill  Athletic  Association."  The  Secretaryship  of 
this  body  has  been  held  by  C.  W.  Wilson,  Med.  '86,  in  1884;  J.  A. 
Springle,  Med.  '88,  in  1886;  C.  H.  MacNutt,  Sc.  '88,  in  1887;  J.  C. 
Hickson,  Arts  '95,  in  1893;  F.  E.  L.  Johnston,  Med.  '96,  in  1894;  F.  W. 
MacLennan,  Sc.  '98,  in  1896;  A.  C.  P.  Howard,  Med.  '01,  in  1897;  John 
Todd,  Med.  '01,  in  1898.  The  President  for  1899  is  Percy  Molson,  Arts 
'01.  Among  the  events  on  the  Annual  Field  Day,  Alpha  Psi  has  always 
been  well  represented.  Five  college  records  are  held,  three  by  H.  M. 
Robertson,  Med.  '97,  one  by  John  Todd,  Med.  '01,  and  one  by  Percy 
Molson,  Arts  '01.  In  1894,  the  Governors  of  the  University  presented  a 
trophy  for  the  all-round  athletic  championship,  to  be  competed  for 
annually.  This  was  won  in  18%  by  H.  M.  Robertson,  and  in  1898 
and  in  1899  by  Percy  Molson.  Last  spring  an  Intercollegiate  Athletic 
Association  was  formed,  the  chairman  of  which  was  A.  C.  P.  Howard, 
Med.  '01.  The  first  meeting  was  held  in  Montreal  in  October,  and  on 
the  victorious  McGill  Track  Team  were  Todd,  MacLennan,  Molson  and 
Percy,  Sc.  '00. 

In  June,  1899,  in  the  International  contest  for  small  yachts  on  Lake 
St.  Louis,  between  the  "Glencairne,  III."  of  the  Royal  St.  Lawrence 
Yacht  Club  of  Montreal,  and  the  "Constance"  of  the  Seawanhaka- 
Corinthian  Yacht  Club  of  New  York,  Shirley  Davidson,  B.  Ap.  Sc.  '97, 
was  one  of  the  crew  of  the  defender,  which  was  so  ably  sailed  to  victory 
by  her  designer,  Bro.  G.  Herrick  Duggan,  '84,  of  Theta  Xi. 

The  college  paper  has  been  published  under  three  titles,  first  it  was 
the  McGill  Gazette,  which  ceased  publication  in  1890,  but  which  was  re- 
organized in  1892  as  the  McGill  Fortnightly.  In  1898  it  was  issued 
weekly  under  the  title  of  the  McGill  Outlook.  The  chapter  has  been 
represented  every  year  on  the  Editorial  Board  and  twice  by  the  Editor- 
in-Chief.  In  musical  circles  Alpha  Psi  has  been  conspicuous  by  its 
absence.  Though  numbering  among  its  members  many  accomplished 
musicians,  but  two  Brothers  have  held  office  in  the  Glee  and  Banjo  Club. 


808  ALPHA  PSI  CHAPTER 

The  offices  of  President  of  the  fourth  year,  and  the  Valedictorian 
(the  two  most  important  posts  of  the  year)  have  been  frequently  held  by 
Brothers  in  Arts,  Science  and  Law,  and  on  two  or  three  occasions  by 
those  in  Medicine. 

Several  Brothers  have  been  attracted  to  the  Military  Service.  In 
the  spring  of  1885,  the  Half-Breed  Rebellion,  under  the  leadership  of 
Louis  Riel,  broke  out  in  the  Canadian  Northwest.  The  call  to  arms 
was  responded  to  in  Alpha  Psi  by  every  available  man  volunteering 
his  services,  three  of  the  number,  A.  W.  Worthington,  Med.  '86,  J.  A. 
Kinloch,  Med.  '86,  and  W.  I.  Bradley,  Med.  '88,  were  appointed  dressers 
on  the  Field  Hospital  Corps.  When  Worthington  and  Bradley  reached 
Battleford  they  met  eleven  Zetes  from  Theta  Xi,  ten  belonging  to  the 
Queen's  Own  Rifles  of  Toronto,  both  officers  and  privates,  and  one  on 
the  Red  Cross  Ambulance  Corps.  A  meeting  extraordinary  was  held  in 
an  empty  shack;  the  business  consisted  in  appointing  a  committee  to 
erect  a  cairn  on  the  banks  of  the  Battle  River  and  in  directing  the 
secretary  to  communicate  with  the  chapters  represented  to  have  the  meet- 
ing recorded  on  their  respective  minutes.  At  Batoche,  Worthington 
distinguished  himself  by  rescuing  a  wounded  priest  from  under  a  heavy 
fire,  and  was  specially  mentioned  in  the  dispatches  of  the  surgeon- 
general.  C.  E.  Cameron,  M.  D.  '83,  and  J.  M.  Elder,  Med.  '85,  had 
also  been  ordered  to  the  front  as  surgeon  and  assistant  surgeon  of  the 
Montreal  Garrison  Artillery.  After  peace  had  been  restored,  R.  A.  E. 
Greenshields,  B.  C.  L.  '85,  was  appointed  junior  counsel  to  defend 
Louis  Riel,  but  his  silver-tongued  oratory  failed  to  save  the  rebel  from 
the  gallows. 

In  1897,  when  a  body  of  troops  was  sent  to  represent  Canada  at  the 
celebrations  connected  with  Her  Majesty's  Diamond  Jubilee  in  London, 
C.  W.  Wilson,  M.  D.  '86,  had  the  good  fortune  to  be  appointed  the 
surgeon  to  the  contingent.  In  the  Spanish- American  War,  C.  H.  Mac- 
Nutt,  B.  Ap.  Sc.  '88,  served  in  Cuba,  and  F.  T.  Metcalfe,  M.  D.  '88, 
was  executive  officer  on  the  U.  S.  hospital  ship  "Relief." 

In  October,  1899,  on  the  outbreak  of  the  war  between  Great  Britain 
and  the  Boers,  Canada  sent  a  regiment  of  one  thousand  men  to  South 
Africa.  The  surgeons  appointed  to  the  regiment  were  C.  W.  Wilson  and 
A.  B.  Osborne.  The  chapter  entertained  the  two  Brothers  by  a  supper 
in  the  chapter  room,  on  the  eve  of  their  departure,  at  which  nearly  every 
resident  elder  and  active  member  was  present  to  wish  them  "good  luck. " 
The  meeting  held  prior  to  the  supper  was  the  300th  meeting  of  the 
chapter.  In  January,  1900,  when 'four  squadrons  of  mounted  infantry 
and  four  batteries  of  artillery  were  also  sent  to  the  seat  of  war,  A.  N. 
Worthington,  M.  D.  '86,  was  appointed  surgeon  to  the  cavalry,  and  L. 
E.  W.  Irving,  '97,  received  a  commission  as  lieut.  of  artillery. 

Twice  has  the  Alpha  Psi  Chapter  had  the  privilege  of  entertaining 
the  Grand  Chapter,  the  first  time  being  the  41st  Annual  Convention,  on 
the  6th  and  7th  of  January,  1888,  Israel  C.  Pierson  $,  '65,  Phi  Alpha, 
presiding;  and  the  second  time  the  53d  Annual  Convention,  on  the  6th  and 
7th  of  January,  1899,  Fred  R.  Drake,  T  '86,  Phi  Alpha,  presiding.  On 
both  occasions  a  large-  amount  of  business  was  transacted,  and  the 
Canadian  winter  sports  and  other  entertainments  proved  a  decided  novelty 
to  the  majority  of  the  visitors.  The  chapter  has  since  its  foundation  been 
represented  at  every  meeting  of  the  Grand  Chapter  by  one  or  more  dele- 
gates. Three  Grand  Offices  have  been  held,  Guy  F.  Palmer,  M.  D.  '85, 
2  p  A,  in  1886-7;  Wyatt  Johnston,  M.  D.  '84,  2  A,  in  1887-8;  and 
Kenneth  Cameron,  M.  D.  '87,  $  A,  in  1899-1900.  While  Wyatt  G. 
Johnston  was  Sigma  Alpha  he  obtained  permission  from  the  Grand 
Chapter  to  publish  a  directory  list,  containing  the  names  and  addresses 
of  all  members  of  the  fraternity  whose  whereabouts  were  known.  He  was 
for  a  time  a  member  of  the  committee  of  Patriarchs.  Kenneth  Cameron, 
$  A,  presided  at  the  establishment  of  the  Alpha  Beta  Chapter,  in  the 
University  of  Minnesota,  on  August  26,  1899.  Two  convention  poems 


ALPHA  PSI  CHAPTER  809 

have  been  read  by  members  of  the  chapter.  At  Easton,  in  1886,  Guy 
F.  Palmer  depicted  "A  Phanton  Convention"  in  truly  classic  style, 
and  in  1899,  at  Montreal,  Prof.  C.  W.  Colby  read  a  most  scholarly 
composition,  entitled  "De  Amicitia. " 

The  Alpha  Psi  Chapter  has  never  possessed  a  chapter  house,  though 
the  sentiment  of  its  members  has  alwaj's  been  in  favor  of  having  one. 
A  committee  has  existed  for  some  years  whose  purpose  is  to  collect  funds 
to  enable  the  chapter,  at  some  future  date,  to  purchase  a  suitable  dwel- 
ling place.  The  chapter  has  occupied  several  different  chapter  rooms, 
which  have  always  been  conveniently  situated  and  spacious  enough  to 
accommodate  even  the  large  number  of  members  which  attend  on  special 
occasions. 

As  there  are  no  residences  at  McGill  and  the  students  of  the  several 
faculties  have  but  few  opportunities  for  becoming  well-known  to  one 
another,  the  organization  of  Zeta  Psi,  with  its  close  fraternal  bonds  and 
high  ideals,  has  become  a  factor  of  inestimable  value  in  the  University 
life  of  its  members.

HISTORY  OF  THE  NU  CHAPTER 

The  city  of  Cleveland  is  one  of  the  great  industrial  centres  of  this 
country.  The  manufactures  and  commerce  of  a  community  possessing 
great  natural  advantages  have  been  organized  and  directed  with  won- 
derful energy  and  ability  until  at  the  present  time  Cleveland  holds  a 
proud  rank  among  our  larger  cities. 

Her  progressive  citizens,  while  developing  the  material  advantages 
of  the  city  have  not  been  unmindful  of  the  fact  that  educated  leadership 
is  the  surest  means  of  promoting  and  securing  industrial  supremacy. 
Profoundly  impressed  with  the  truth  of  this  idea,  Leonard  Case  in  1876 
gave  in  trust  an  endowment  for  a  technical  school,  to  be  called  "The 
Case  School  of  Applied  Science. "  The  endowment  at  the  time  of  the  deed 
of  trust  amounted  to  about  $2,000,000,  the  bulk  of  this  being  in  land  in 
the  centre  of  the  city,  which  has  since  greatly  increased  in  value.  The 
City  Hall  and  the  land  upon  which  it  stands  are  part  of  the  property,  and 
much  other  real  estate  adjoining  it  is  owned  by  the  school.  Instruction 
was  commenced  in  1881  in  the  former  residence  of  Mr.  Case,  on  Rock- 
well Ave.,  where  the  school  was  domiciled  until,  in  1885,  it  was  removed 
to  its  present  site,  on  Euclid  Ave.,  where  it  occupied  what  is  now  the 
main  building,  which  was  the  only  one  erected  at  that  time.  The  Case 
School  has  eminently  justified  the  wisdom  of  her  founder,  and  now  ranks 
among  the  leading  technical  schools  of  the  country. 

This  field  seemed  to  a  number  of  the  elders  of  Zeta  Psi  residing  in 
Cleveland  to  be  an  excellent  one  for  the  founding  of  a  chapter  of  Zeta 
Psi,  and  during  the  college  year  1883-4  definite  steps  were  taken  toward 
the  establishment  of  a  local  chapter.  Bro.  John  Eisenmann,  3  '71,  at 
that  time  professor  of  civil  engineering  at  the  Case  School,  was  able 
to  impress  the  Brothers  that  no  opposition  to  their  project  would  be  en- 
countered on  the  part  of  the  Faculty.  Advised  by  Bro.  Liberty  E. 
Holden,  X  and  3  '58,  at  that  time  $  A  of  the  Fraternity,  and  other  Cleve- 
land elders,  Bro.  Eisenmann  conferred  with  Mr.  D.  R.  Warmington,  '85, 
with  reference  to  the  organization  of  a  local  club  of  students,  whose 
formation  he  advised  for  the  purpose  of  petitioning  for  a  charter  in  the 
Z  W  Fraternity.  Mr.  Warmington  associated  with  himself  five  other 
students,  who,  upon  the  subsequent  installation  of  the  chapter,  became, 
with  him,  the  charter  members.  The  members  of  the  club,  as  then 
organized,  were  D.  R.  Warmington,  '85,  president;  W.  L.  Merriam,  '86, 
vice-president;  L.  E.  Ritter,  '86,  secretary;  G.H.Gardner,  '86,  treasurer; 
W.  A.  Neff,  '86,  sergeant-at-arms;  F.  H.  Neff,  '87.  Bro.  Eisenmann, 
with  the  assistance  of  Bros.  J.  D.  Ketchum,  II  '72,  and  J.  E.  Ensign,  3 
'74,  drew  up  a  petition,  which  was  signed  by  the  students  above  men- 
tioned and  endorsed  by  the  following  elder  residents  of  Cleveland:  L. 
E.  Holden,  X3  '58;  J.  D.  Ketchum,  H  '72;  John  Eisenmann,  3  '71; 
J.  E.  Ensign,  3  '74;  H.  C.  Ford,  3  '75;  S.  F.  Chisholm,  ZT'72;  A.  H. 
Cowles,  W  '81;  H.  R.  Edwards,  P  '83;  R.  C.  Cole,  W82;  L.H.  Cowles, 
WM. 

The  3  Chapter,  at  Ann  Arbor,  whose  Cleveland  elders  had  taken 
such  an  active  part  in  forwarding  the  movement  for  a  chapter,  sent  a 
committee  of  its  active  members,  consisting  of  Bros.  T.  J.  Ballinger,  '87, 
and  John  E.  Miller,  '87,  to  investigate  the  standing  of  the  petitioners 
and  to  report  upon  the  advisability  of  forming  a  chapter  at  the  Case 
School.  Their  favorable  report,  together  with  a  resolution  of  the  3 
Chapter  asking  that  the  petition  be  granted,  were  forwarded  to  the  Grand 
Chapter,  and  by  it,  with  the  original  petition,  presented  to  the  several 
chapters  for  action.  The  charter  was,  after  careful  consideration, 
granted  on  October  24,  1884. 

The  honor  of  initiating  the  charter  members  of  the  new  chapter  and 
of  installing  the  chapter  fell  to  the  active  members  of  the  3,  and  on 


834  NU  CHAPTER 

Thanksgiving-  Day,  Nov.  27,  1884,  D.  R.  Warmington,  G.  H.  Gardner, 
W.  A.  Neff  and  F.  H.  Neff  were  duly  initiated  at  Ann  Arbor  by  the  ac- 
tive members  of  the  5  and  installed  as  a  chapter  of  the  Z  W  Fraternity 
at  the  Case  School  of  Applied  Science.  The  chapter  letter  N  was  given 
to  the  chapter  at  the  next  annual  Convention  of  the  Fraternity.  Immedi- 
ately following1  the  installation  the  3  Chapter  tendered  a  banquet  to 
the  new  initiates. 

The  new  chapter,  assisted  by  the  Cleveland  elders,  initiated  W.  L. 
Merriam  and  L.  E.  Ritter  on  the  13th  of  December  at  the  West 
Side  Odd  Fellows'  Hall.  These  two  Brothers  were  unfortunately  unable 
to  attend  the  installation  at  Ann  Arbor,  but  as  original  petitioners, 
identified  with  the  movement  from  its  inception,  they  deserve  to  be 
ranked  among  the  charter  members. 

Through  the  assistance  of  the  Cleveland  elders  a  suite  of  apartments 
in  the  Heyse  Block  was  obtained  and  furnished  as  lodge  rooms  but  the 
transference  of  the  school  to  its  permanent  site  at  the  east  end  made 
advisable  a  removal  of  the  chapter  rooms  to  the  vicinity  of  the  campus, 
and  in  September,  1886,  the  chapter  took  possession  of  its  new  apartments 
in  Fairmount  Court,  at  the  corner  of  Euclid  Ave.  and  Fairmount  St., 
where  the  Nu  had  its  house  for  the  next  six  years. 

For  one  year  the  chapter  rented  a  house  and  attempted  the  experi- 
ment of  conducting  a  chapter  house  at  which  the  Brothers  could  live. 
Many  of  the  Brothers  lived  at  their  own  homes  in  the  city  and  this  financial 
burden  proved  so  great  that  the  other  activities  of  the  chapter  life  were 
in  danger  of  neglect,  so  it  seemed  wise  not  to  renew  the  lease  at  the 
end  of  the  year.  Since  1894  the  chapter  moved  from  the  old  apartments 
in  Fairmount  Court  to  a  house  overlooking  the  campus,  which  it 
occupied  until  June,  1899,  when  it  returned  for  the  third  time  to  its 
old  hall  in  Fairmount  Court,  which  has  been  the  scene  of  many  good 
times,  and  of  much  earnest  work  for  the  advancement  of  Z  W.  In  its 
old  home  the  chapter  looks  forward  to  a  career  of  renewed  usefulness 
and  prosperity. 

In  the  intellectual,  social  and  athletic  activities  of  college  life  the 
members  of  the  Nu  Chapter  have  had  their  share  of  honors.  The 
football  team  of  1893,  coached  and  captained  by  Bro.  Smith,  '94,  won  the 
State  championship  and  the  winning  football  teams  of  1896-7  were 
both  years  captained  by  Bro.  Stevens,  '98. 

The  members  of  the  Nu  have  not  only  done  their  duty  upon  college 
fields  of  battle  but  they  responded  to  the  call  of  the  nation  by  enlisting 
for  the  Spanish-American  War  four  of  their  number,  Bros.  George 
Stevens,  '98,  sergt.,  and  Sherman  Wright  Scofield,  '98,  priv.,  Troop  A, 
1st  Ohio  Vol.  Cav.;  Homer  D.  Heman,  '99,  Corp.,  Co.  C,  2d  Ohio  Vol. 
Inf.,  and  Henry  L.  Thomas,  '99,  mem.  of  Signal  Corps,  although  none 
of  them  reached  the  seat  of  war. 

The  Nu  has  always  kept  its  numbers  small,  believing  that  thereby 
greater  harmony  and  more  intimate  fellowship  result  than  with  large 
numbers,  but  it  has  also  suffered  at  times  from  the  danger,  to  which  this 
policy  is  always  liable,  of  being  greatly  weakened  by  the  unexpected 
loss  of  a  number  of  active  members. 

A  Zeta  Psi  Association  has  been  organized  in  Cleveland  by  the 
resident  elders  of  the  Fraternity,  which  is  to  hold  at  least  four  meetings 
a  year  with  the  Nu  Chapter.  The  frequent  presence  and  interest  of 
prominent  elders  should  prove  a  source  of  great  help  to  the  active 
chapter  and  should  enable  it  to  take  and  to  maintain  an  even  higher 
position  than  it  has  hitherto  filled  in  the  college  and  fraternity  world.

HISTORY  OF  THE  ETA  CHAPTER 

The  Eta  Chapter  of  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity  was  established  at  Yale 
University  in  1889.  The  conditions  of  fraternity  life  at  Yale  have  been, 
and  are  now,  different  from  those  existing  at  any  other  college  in  which 
there  is  a  chapter  of  Zeta  Psi  or,  perhaps,  at  any  other  college  in  America. 

From  1701,  in  which  year  Yale  was  founded  with  a  few  books,  one 
instructor  and  one  student,  until  1839,  no  fraternity,  except  #  B  K,  was 
represented  at  Yale.  For  many  years  before  1889  there  had  been  but  , 
two  Greek-letter  fraternities  at  Yale,  one  established  in  1839,  and  another 
founded  in  1844.  A  third  fraternity  had  maintained  a  chapter  for  some 
time,  but  had  withdrawn  it.  All  of  these  were  conducted  strictly  as 
Junior  societies.  Some  Freshman  and  Sophomore  societies  had  lived  for 
a  time  until,  by  faculty  restrictions,  they  ceased  to  exist  as  recognized 
organizations  and  the  Senior  society  system  formed  the  strongest  in- 
centive toward  individual  effort,  as  an  election  to  one  of  these  societies 
usually  meant  preeminence  in  some  department  of  Yale  life. 

By  1889  the  number  of  students  at  Yale  had  grown  to  over  eleven 
hundred,  and  from  each  class  of  the  Academic  or  Arts  Department, 
now  called  Yale  College,  not  more  than  about  one-fourth  would  receive 
election  to  the  Greek-letter  fraternities.  Under  these  circumstances  it 
was  evident  that  there  was  ample  opportunity  for  further  fraternity  de- 
velopment, and  Zeta  Psi  was  one  of  the  fraternities  which  recognized 
this  fact.  The  Eta  Chapter  of  Zeta  Psi  began  with  ten  men,  who  were 
initiated  upon  the  24th  day  of  May,  1889,  at  the  Zeta  Psi  Club,  No.  8 
W.  29th  Street,  New  York  City,  by  Bros.  Albert  H.  Gallatin,  <?,  acting 
$  A;  Henry  T.  Thomas,  fl,  acting  A  $  A;  E.  McDougall  Hawkes,  A, 
acting  2  A ;  D.  Homer  Bates,  A,  acting  A  2  A ;  William  K.  Otis,  A, 
acting  2  p  A. 

Bro.  and  Hon.  Samuel  B.  Stunner,  Z,  past  $  A,  and  Bro.  Walter  G. 
Eliot,  A,  past  A  $  A,  were  instrumental  in  securing  a  charter  for  the 
chapter  and  Bro.  Eliot  also  immediately  started  upon  the  great  under- 
taking of  building  a  chapter  house.  By  the  kindness  of  Bro.  Albert 
Buchman,  plans  were  prepared  and  a  Building  Committee  from  the 
chapter,  composed  of  Bros.  Corson,  '91,  Munson,  '90,  Robbins,  '91,  Ding- 
ley,  '92,  and  Hart,  '91,  was  appointed.  Great  efforts  were  immediately 
made  and  Bro.  Eliot  gave  his  personal  attention  and  much  time  and 
labor  toward  building  the  house.  The  financial  plans  and  operations 
were  carried  on  entirely  through  him  until  the  completed  house  was 
turned  over  to  the  chapter  on  June  6,  1891.  This  chapter  house  repre- 
sented an  outlay  of  about  $8,000  and  was,  like  the  other  society  buildings 
at  Yale,  a  plain,  entirely  closed  building,  practically  without  windows, 
and  devoted  solely  to  chapter  purposes.  The  dormitory  system  at  Yale 
is  responsible  for  the  uniform  character  of  the  society  houses  and  none 
of  them  is  occupied  by  any  of  the  members  of  the  chapter,  or  resembles 
the  fraternity  houses  at  other  American  colleges. 

The  system  of  class  fraternities  by  which  associations  and  friend- 
ships are  formed  between  members  of  one  class  or  the  members  of  one 
class  in  a  fraternity,  and  the  fact  that  a  man  is  not  associated  with  the 
members  of  any  one  society  throughout  the  whole  four  years  of  his  course 
renders  the  loyalty  of  Yale  men  to  their  classes  and  to  their  Alma  Mater 
the  striking  feature  of  our  University.  This  was  recognized  and  antici- 
pated in  Zeta  Psi,  and  the  strongest  effort  has  always  been  made  to 
inculcate  the  same  loyalty  to  Zeta  Psi  and  to  each  other.  This  has 
resulted  in  a  marked  degree  of  success  so  noticeable,  in  fact,  as  to  cause 
favorable  comment  from  those  who  realize  the  tendency  in  an  opposite 
direction  where  no  effort  is  put  forth  to  prevent  it. 

The  very  facts  that  Zeta  Psi  is  the  youngest  fratfrnity  at  Yale  (in 
the  Academic  Department),  and  that  work  has  been  necessary  to  insure 


848  ETA  CHAPTER 

growth  and  improvement,  have  had  the  tendency  to  increase  fraternal 
feeling  and  the  loyalty  of  each  initiate  to  the  rest  of  the  chapter. 

•  During  the  first  ten  years  of  the  life  of  the  chapter  its  history  shows 
the  customary  gradual  increase  in  influence,  the  resulting  gain  in  inter- 
nal strength  and  a  goodly  proportion  of  college  honors  falling  to  the  lot 
of  its  members.  The  class  of  '91  was  marked  for  its  especial  part  in  the 
literary  life  of  the  college,  and  in  each  class  are  Zetes  who  have  been  on 
the  editorial  boards  of  the  various  college  publications  and  in  high  places 
on  the  honor  lists  of  scholarship.  The  University  athletic  teams  have 
also  had  representatives  from  Zeta  Psi  in  each  year.  At  the  outbreak 
of  the  Spanish  war  a  number  of  Zetes  were  in  the  college  military 
companies  and  immediately  enlisted  in  the  Yale  Troop  of  the  Connecticut 
2Ieavy  Artillery,  which  was  detailed  to  camp  duty  at  "Camp  Haven," 
and  several  men  who  belonged  to  the  Naval  Reserve  enlisted  in  that 
service  and  did  duty  on  the  old  monitor  "Wyandotte"  in  New  Haven 
harbor.  One  initiation  was  held  while  the  monitor  was  at  New  Haven, 
and  the  poor  candidate  is  said  to  have  spent  some  time  at  the  bottom  of 
the  hold  meditating  upon  his  present  state. 

The  growth  of  this  chapter  and  the  need  of  a  .more  complete  house 
became  so  apparent  by  1897  that  work  was  begun  in  the  fall  of  that  year 
to  collect  money  for  this  purpose.  This  was  so  successfully  accom- 
plished that  ground  was  broken  in  August,  1898,  and  by  April,  1899, 
the  new  house  was  ready  for  occupancy.  It  is  a  large  building,  25  by 
120  feet,  with  a  front  of  Indiana  limestone  and  a  promenade  roof.  A 
number  of  stained-glass  windows  have  been  placed  in  the  building,  a 
new  departure  for  Yale,  and  one  which  has  proved  very  advantageous 
for  both  light  and  ventilation.  Bro.  Albert  Buchman,  W,  F  A,  drew  the 
plans  and  supervised  the  construction  of  the  entire  building,  and  the 
Eta  Chapter  feels  deeply  grateful  to  him  for  his  work  in  their  behalf. 
Bros.  Warner,  '99,  and  Boyd,  '99,  were  the  Building  Committee  from 
the  chapter,  and  the  Board  of  Trustees  had  general  supervision  of  the 
work.  The  trustees  are  Bros.  Corson,  '91,  Marsh,  '92,  Woodruff,  '92, 
Chatfield,  '93,  and  Garvan,  '94.  Bros.  Coonley,  '94,  Dickson,  '94,  Cow- 
drey,  '96,  and  Sutro,  '96,  acted  as  a  committee  from  the  graduates  in  aid 
of  the  trustees.  The  Eta  Chapter  is  greatly  indebted  to  Bro.  Thos.  I. 
Chatfield,  '93,  for  the  spirit  of  courage  and  enthusiasm  which  he 
imparted  to  the  Brothers,  and  for  the  wise  counsel,  untiring  zeal  and 
efficient  assistance  which  he  gave  to  the  enterprise.  He  presented  the 
house  to  the  chapter  in  behalf  of  the  trustees  on  the  occasion  of  the 
"Spring  Play, "  May  29,  1899,  when  it  was  formally  opened.  There 
were  present  several  Grand  Officers  and  representatives  of  other  chapters, 
including  Bros.  Chas.  C.  Harrison,  Provost  of  the  Univ.  Pa.,  and  William 
Platt  Pepper,  both  of  the  Sigma  Chapter ;  Col.  Henry  Walker,  Rho ;  Com. 
David  Banks  and  Israel  C.  Pierson,  Phi ;  and  Albert  Buchman,  Psi. 
Bro.  Chatfield  has  been  ~2  A  of  the  Fraternity  since  1896. 

This  new  chapter  house  is  built  upon  the  same  site  as  the  older  house, 
on  a  block  partly  occupied  by  the  college  buildings,  and  represents  an 
expenditure  of  over  $27,000.  The  chapter  was  incorporated  by  an  Act 
of  the  Legislature  of  Connecticut  in  1893,  under  the  name  of  "The  Eta 
Chapter  of  Zeta  Psi  Association."  Corporate  power  is  vested  in  five 
trustees,  of  whom  one  is  elected  each  year  for  a  term  of  five  years. 

The  Eta  Chapter  is  grow  ing  rapidly,  and  already  has  a  strong  place 
in  the  Fraternity  Circle  of  Chapters.  It  is  building  with  an  eye  to  the 
future,  as  well  as  the  present,  and  with  the  hope  and  promise  of  having 
no  small  part  in  the  growth  of  our  fraternity.  The  history  of  so  short  a 
period  of  life — little  more  than  ten  years — cannot  be  extensive,  and  the 
members  of  the  chapter  are  young  men  in  comparison  with  many  of  the 
Brothers  of  other  chapters ;  but  the  same  spirit  inspires  all,  and  the 
Eta  will  try  to  follow  out  that  spirit  and  continue  to  be  worthy  of  a  place 
upon  the  roll  of  Zeta  Psi.

HISTORY  OF  THE  MU  CHAPTER 

The  world  knew  of  Stanford  University  long  before  the  red- 
tiled  roofs  had  been  fitted  above  her  sandstone  walls;  the  death  abroad 
of  young  Stanford  and  the  resolve  of  the  aged  multi-millionaire  parents 
to  build  to  their  only  son  a  monument  after  the  inclination  of  his  own 
life,  had  been  of  interest  to  many  outside  of  this  country;  the  corner- 
stone had  been  laid  under  the  Riviera-like  sky  which  spreads  above  the 
broad  Palo  Alto  ranch  and  the  people  of  California  were  waiting  to  see 
the  students  flock  to  the  completed  Quadrangle.  Across  San  Francisco 
Bay,  upon  the  green  foothills  of  Berkeley,  satthe  University  of  California, 
with  any  number  of  zealous  fraternities  gathered  to  her  bosom  during  her 
quarter-century  reign.  It  is  characteristic  that  in  the  Zeta  Psi  Hall, 
the  first  fraternity  house  at  Berkeley,  the  Iota  Chapter  should  be  wait- 
ing with  the  rest  of  the  world  and  thinking  ahead  of  them.  A  chapter 
at  the  new  institution  would  mean  a  great  deal  to  the  men  of  Iota — 
cooperation,  mutual  interest  and  fellowship.  She  herself  had  been 
first  on  the  ground  at  Berkeley.  So  before  the  young  University  had 
opened,  the  Berkeley  men  were  getting  acquainted  with  such  youthful 
argonauts  as  had  openly  avowed  their  intention  to  pass  the  older  college 
by  and  cast  in  their  lot  with  her  who  was  farheralded  but  untried. 
Their  foresight  has  been  proven  wisdom.  To-day  the  Iota  men  are  links 
in  the  circle  that  closes  round  the  banquet  table  on  initiation  nights  at 
the  Mu;  the  Stanford  alumnus,  fresh  from  the  unequalled  fellowship  of 
his  chapter  house  and  separated  from  it  by  thirty-five  miles  of  railroad, 
slips  over  from  San  Francisco  after  business  hours  and  finds  cronies 
and  a  welcome  in  the  big  house  on  the  heights  of  Berkeley.  And  the 
two  chapters,  after  the  trying  test  of  the  Thanksgiving  game,  join  hands 
for  the  annual  banquet  in  town. 

lota's  correspondence  with  the  fraternity  at  large  was  not  encour- 
aging. Zeta  Psi  was  no  more  anxious  in  those  days  to  extend  her  chapter 
roll  than  is  she  to-day  when  petitions  and  references  pour  in  upon  her 
and  interested  parties  plead  in  vain.  But  the  Berkeley  men  had  started 
their  snowball  and  it  was  swelling  rapidly.  Shirley  Baker,  '95,  an 
Oakland  boy  with  a  voice  and  a  banjo,  who  eventually  became  the  best- 
loved  by  faculty  and  class  alike,  was  their  first  find  and  with  such  a 
man  to  begin  with  the  end  was  not  yet.  Baker  and  Champlin,  '95,  were 
on  the  campus  early  and,  when  the  crowds  came  into  the  sunny  Quad- 
rangle the  first  day  in  October,  1891,  and  listened  to  the  dedication 
speeches,  these  two  were  not  idle.  Dray,  Simmons,  Miller,  Kautz, 
Adams  and  Unruh,  all  freshmen  of  '95,  had  put  their  names  down, 
testifying  to  a  "favorable  opinion."  Still  there  was  no  sign  of  a  recip- 
rocal feeling  on  the  part  of  the  Grand  Chapter. 

Chief  among  the  men  of  Iota  who  w6re  booming  this  prospecting  in 
a  new  region  was  Edwin  Mays,  '93.  He  was  a  record  man  on  the  U. 
of  C.  track  and  he  carried  the  qualities  which  brought  him  fame  on  the 
cinders  into  the  workings  of  his  fraternity.  When  he  got  down  to  busi- 
ness his  stride  was  hard  to  beat.  He  wrote  in  vain  to  the  fraternity 
officials;  it  began  to  look  as  though  a  charter  was  an  idle  dream.  Then 
Mays,  shutting  his  hands,  sprinted  for  the  Convention  at  Philadelphia. 
But  it  was  not  easy  for  Mays  at  first.  He  found  a  strong  prejudice 
against  another  excursion  beyond  the  Rockies;  chapters  so  remote 
seemed  to  the  officials  productive  of  little  good.  But  his  enthusiasm  was 
successful.  To-day  the  mother  fraternity  says  nice  things  of  the  infant 
and  Bro.  Mays'  picture  hangs  by  the  Mu  fireside. 

The  nine  men  who  came  to  bat  for  Zeta  Psi  the  first  year  of  Stanford 
were  men  whose  personalities  have  colored  the  chapter  from  their  day  to 
this.  They  were  men  without  any  affectation  or  pretension,  even- 


874  MU  CHAPTER 

tempered,  conscientious  and  so  thoroughly  in  harmony  that  even  their 
competitors  admitted  them  to  be  the  most  closely  bonded  of  the  crowds  in 
college.  Their  incomes  were  modest  and  they  lived  within  them;  clothes 
counted  for  little  with  them ;  they  looked  for  the  man  inside.  They  were 
representative  men,  too;  Adams  was  the  first  president  of  the  class  and 
the  college's  champion  all-round  athlete ;  Baker,  Kautz  and  Simmons 
were  good  musicians  and  Dray  was  a  prize  student.  Miller  and 
Champlin  enjoyed  the  friendship  of  Senator  Stanford  and  his  wife.  The 
influence  of  these  pioneers  has  reached  down  through  successive  initi- 
ations to  the  men  who  are  keeping  up  the  standard  at  the  University  to- 
day. The  Mu  has  led  socially  from  the  very  beginning  and  this  without 
entertaining  or  any  ostentation  whatever;  her  men  have  been  prominent 
in  every  interest  of  the  college  life,  musical,  literary,  dramatic,  athletic, 
political;  they  have  enjoyed  a  creditable  amount  of  faculty  favor,  and 
they  have  succeeded  in  giving  the  people  who  come  as  guests  into  their 
house  a  sense  of  having  met  the  "real  thing"  in  the  fraternity  life  of  the 
place.  The  men  who  began  this  were  all  freshmen,  remember.  Older 
fraternity  men  came  from  other  colleges,  entering  in  the  small  upper 
classes  that  marked  the  early  years  of  the  University,  and  gathered 
freshmen  about  them  and  got  their  charters  but  the  Zeta  Psi  youngsters 
were  already  some  distance  down  the  road  and  at  this  writing  have  not 
yet  been  caught  up  with. 

At  first  all  initiations  were  held  at  Berkeley  under  the  protecting 
eye  and  superior  equipment  of  the  Iota.  Senator  Stanford,  through  the 
boys  he  knew  in  the  chapter,  had  become  interested  in  the  society  and 
had  even  gone  so  far  as  to  have  plans  drawn,  looking  toward  the  building 
of  a  house  for  them.  The  Zetes  had  their  share  in  the  painful  doubt  and 
uncertainty  that  followed  the  sudden  death  of  their  friend,  the  Founder. 
In  the  confusion  that  followed,  when  the  estate  was  unsettled  and  the 
Government's  suit  against  Mrs.  Stanford  for  fifteen  millions  of  dollars 
was  threatening  the  very  life  of  the  institution,  these  plans,  over  which 
many  a  pleasant  evening  had  been  spent  at  the  Stanford  residence,  went 
astray  and  though  Mrs.  Stanford  has  kept  her  kindly  interest  in  the 
chapter  the  matter  has  had  to  rest. 

The  fraternity  granted  a  chatter  to  the  Mu  on  January  9th,  1892. 
Subsequently  a  heated  argument  resulted  in  the  decision  that  Zeta  Psi 
was  the  first  fraternity  upon  the  campus  and  so  her  roll  of  members 
follows  the  mysterious  design  that  ushers  in  the  list  of  fraternities  in  the 
college  annual. 

Lewis,  '95,  was  initiated  the  second  semester  of  the  first  year.  The 
following  year  Baldwin,  Hatfield,  Belong  and  Faxon,  '96  men,  were 
added  to  the  ranks.  When  the  third  year  opened,  but  five  men  returned 
to  college.  This  was  cause  for  dismay.  Other  fraternities  were  living 
in  houses  of  their  own  with  a  good  force  of  rushers  to  bring  in  occupants 
for  vacant  rooms.  The  Zetes  were  still  in  the  dormitory,  with  some  of 
their  best-known  men  gone,  but  dismay  was  an  unlearned  vice;  with  the 
help  of  two  good  Iota  men,  Kelley  and  Mays,  they  reached  out  unfalter- 
ing hands  and  drew  in  Barstow,  '95,  Campbell,  '96,  and  Ellis,  Thomas, 
Lincoln  and  Turner,  '97.  Early  in  the  term  the  chapter  moved  to 
Mariposa  Hall,  a  boarding-house  on  the  campus,  where  they  were  given 
the  entire  upper  floor.  After  Christmas  the  names  of  Diehl,  '97,  and 
Field,  '95,  were  added  to  the  register.  Coincident  with  their  initiation 
was  the  moving  of  the  chapter  into  a  house  of  its  own.  Military  drill 
was  abandoned  in  college,  and  the  officer's  house,  a  roomy  place  specially 
built  for  him,  was  vacated.  After  some  clever  management  the  Zetes 
secured  it. 

When  the  boys  were  comfortably  located  in  this  new  home,  they 
initiated  by  a  special  service  a  member  whose  influence  upon  the 
chapter  for  the  last  six  years  can  hardly  be  overestimated.  This  was  Mrs. 
Baker,  mother  of  Shirley  Baker  and  the  fraternity  mother.  Her  only 
son  was  in  the  house,  and  she  took  his  friends  to  her  heart  as  well.  To 


MU  CHAPTER  875 

her  is  due  most  of  the  credit  for  the  refinement  and  home  look  that  became 
characteristic  of  the  Zete  house  and  gave  it  the  prestige  that  it  enjoys 
to-day.  Mrs.  Baker  became  the  best-known  woman  upon  the  campus, 
outside  of  the  faculty;  her  enthusiasm  for  the  chapter  knew  no  bounds, 
no  sacrifice  was  too  great  for  her  interest  in  the  boys,  and  many  a  Mu 
man  can  look  back  to  the  days  of  his  college  course  when  Mrs.  Baker 
made  his  fraternity  more  helpful,  his  own  life  better  for  her  gracious 
presence.  Her  son's  work,  since  leaving  Palo  Alto,  has  kept  him  away 
from  her  during  most  of  the  time.  In  his  absences  she  has  gone  loyally 
back  to  "her  boys  "  (at  this  writing  she  is  at  the  house),  where  there  is 
always  a  room  kept  for  her  and  a  college  welcome  ready.  With  the  op- 
portunities of  a  house  of  their  own  the  chapter  might  have  attempted  some 
entertaining.  At  the  close  of  the  second  year  they  gave  an  elaborate 
dance  at  the  Hotel  Vendome  in  San  Jos£,  twenty  miles  distant,  having, 
for  their  guests,  the  luxury  of  a  special  train.  This  was  called  the  first 
annual  hop  of  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity.  It  was  such  an  overwhelming 
success  that  the  second  annual  has  not  yet  been  given.  When  that  great 
event  shall  have  been  forgotten  it  will  be  time  for  another.  In  their  own 
house  the  men  preferred  rather  to  entertain  on  a  small  scale,  with  quiet 
little  gatherings  at  dinner,  or  on  the  big  porch  in  the  moonlight  when 
Baker  sang  and  the  mandolin  club  played. 

Toward  the  end  of  the  third  year  Dr.  Frank  Moss  came  from  To- 
ronto and  built  up  a  practice  in  Palo  Alto.  No  one  has  done  more 
than  he  to  instil  the  spirit  and  feeling  of  Zeta  Psi  into  our  young  chapter. 
His  ringing  speeches  at  the  initiation  suppers  will  not  soon  be  forgotten 
and  the  best  wishes  of  the  boys  follow  him  to  London,  where  he  has  gone 
for  additional  study. 

The  '98  Freshmen  were  a  second  pioneer  class,  an  unusually  strong 
set  of  men,  into  whose  hands  the  chapter  fell  when  the  pioneers  were 
graduated.  These  men  were  Bush,  Sewall,  Sladen,  Hubbard,  Wight, 
Durham  and  Schneider.  Upon  this  auspicious  opening  came  the  first 
shadow  which  has  fallen  upon  the  young  chapter.  Ellis,  '97,  died  after 
a  lingering  illness,  and  his  pallbearers  were  Zetes.  The  minutes  of  the 
meeting-  following  his  death  included  the  follow  ing  verses: 

First  broken  link  of  that  dear  chain 
That  circling  binds  us  heart  to  heart, 

Time  only  dulls,  not  heals  our  pain 

To  know  we  may  not  mend  again 
The  links  that  fall  apart. 

You  who  have  been  the  first  to  die 

Are  not  all  dead  to  us  who  grieve; 
You  loved  in  true  Tau  Kappi  Phi, 
This  fills,  for  us  in  Zeta  Psi, 

The  memory  you  leave. 

And  when  we  grasp,  in  ancient  form, 

The  hands  that  make  this  broken  chain, 
From  that  sweet  stillness  after  storm 
Your  hand  still  gives  a  pressure  warm 
And  makes  it  whole  again! 

Dray,  '95,  was  graduated  a  term  in  advance  of  his  class,  and  went 
immediately  to  Harvard  (Medical),  where  he  made  an  enviable  record. 
He  is  now  assistant  police  surgeon  in  San  Francisco,  and  is  always  glad 
to  welcome  Zetes.  Diehl,  '97,  is  clerk  of  the  police  court  at  Salt  Lake 
City.  These  items  are  here  set  down  for  the  convenience  of  any  visiting 
Brother. 

The  class  of  '99  brought  in  a  goodly  lot  of  Freshmen — Tozer, 
MacCoy,  Smith  and  Bartholomew,  the  last  named  being  especially  use- 
ful in  furnishing  the  house.  He  had  a  sister  at  boarding-school,  and  at 
his  suggestion  a  group  picture  of  the  chapter  was  sent  to  her,  and  her 


876  MU  CHAPTER 

friends  were  requested  to  select  a  man  and  make  him  a  sofa  pillow. 
These  trophies  were  the  property  of  the  smoking-room,  so  those  members 
who  received  none  had  no  grievance  against  the  Adonis  who  was  smoth- 
ered with  express  packages.  Later  in  the  year,  Brantly,  '99,  was 
initiated  with  much  enthusiasm. 

The  spring  of  '96  saw  the  winning  of  the  suit  by  the  University  and 
the  beginning  of  a  new  era  for  the  college — atimeof  confidence,  increased 
revenue  and  hope.  During  the  wild  celebration  of  the  victory  no  house 
on  the  campus  was  more  radiant  with  lanterns  and  fireworks  than 
was  ours. 

Perkins,  Macy,  Van  Voorhies  and  Coleman  came  in  with  1900.  None 
of  this  class  remained  to  graduate.  Later  Murphy,  of  the  same  class, 
was  initiated.  He  played  quarter  on  the  'varsity  that  year,  the  team 
winning  20  to  0.  Every  fraternity  on  the  campus  whispered  longing 
words  to  him,  but  Zeta  Psi  as  usual  did  the  final  speechmaking.  He 
has  continued  the  foremost  athletic  man  in  the  University  and  the  social 
lion  as  a  logical  accompaniment. 

1901  brought  Wadsworth,  Conger,  Whitlock,  Maize  and  Rood.  These 
names  represent  clean  sweeps.  For  the  last  two  or  three  years  it  has 
been  a  case  of  ask  and  receive.  The  representation  in  the  lines  of  col- 
lege activity  increased.  The  following  March,  Riley,  1900,  the  most 
prominent  man  in  college,  musically  and  dramatically,  was  given  the 
pin  and  a  most  cordial  welcome. 

The  Mu  shared  in  the  war  excitement  to  the  extent  of  four  of  her  best 
men.  Whitlock,  '01,  enlisted  as  corporal,  but  his  regiment  was  finally 
mustered  out  after  months  of  weary  waiting  to  be  sent  to  the  front. 
Thomas,  '98,  went  to  Manila  with  the  first  expedition  that  ever  left  our 
country  for  a  foreign  foe.  He  won  promotion  to  first  sergeancy  during 
active  service  in  the  Philippines  and  was  finally  invalided  home  after 
having  typhoid  fever.  He  was  the  most  prominent  Mu  man  of  his  day, 
and  his  letters  from  the  trenches  to  the  chapter  were  widely  read.  Bro. 
Ensign  Cyrus  R.  Miller,  '95,  served  on  U.  S.  S.  "  Oregon,"  was  on  the 
trip  from  San  Francisco  to  Key  West,  took  part  in  the  bombardments 
and  action  of  July  3d,  off  Santiago  de  Cuba,  was  temporarily  attached 
to  the  battleship  "  Massachusetts,"  convoying  Gen.  Miles'  expedition  to 
Puerto  Rico,  and  was  assigned  to  duty  on  his  staff.  The  latter  wrote 
an  official  letter  of  commendation  and  approval  which  was  endorsed  by 
Com.  Higginson.  Bro.  Miller  went  from  New  York  to  Manila  on  the 
"Oregon,"  and  returned  by  the  "Buffalo."  He  is  now  attached  to 
U.  S.  S.  "Albatross,"  cruising  among  the  South  Sea  Islands  on  a 
scientific  expedition.  Bro.  Ensign  Austin  Kautz,  '95,  was  attached  to 
U.  S.  S.  "New  York,"  Admiral  Sampson's  flagship,  and  participated 
in  the  action  at  Santiago  de  Cuba  in  1898. 

With  1902  a  new  era  of  prosperity  began.  Hough,  Naftzger,  Gage, 
Hardy,  Robinson,  Lieb  and  Carson  strengthened  the  chapter  materially. 
Hardy  added  the  distinction  of  Pacific  Coast  tennis  champion  to  the 
athletic  interest  of  the  chapter.  Lieb  is  the  son  of  a  trustee.  This  good 
work  was  followed  this  fall  by  the  initiation  of  Hubbard  and  Lieb  (the 
first  men  to  follow  older  brothers  into  this  young  chapter),  Barnhisel, 
Kickler,  Gurlinger  and  Watt.  These  Freshmen  find  the  Mu  in  a  new 
house,  a  big  roomy  affair  near  the  Quadrangle,  with  ampler  accommoda- 
tion in  every  way.  One  has  but  to  enter  the  door  to  feel  the  atmosphere 
of  prosperity.  The  furniture  and  the  fare  are  simple  but  the  spirit  is 
unbounded,  and  with  nearly  nine  years  of  uninterrupted  success  behind 
her,  the  Mu,  in  the  power  and  promise  of  her  early  youth,  looks  forward 
confidently  to  the  Freshmen  of  the  future.

HISTORY  OF  THE  ALPHA  BETA  CHAPTER 

The  University  of  Minnesota,  the  home  of  the  Alpha  Beta  of  Zeta 
Psi,  is  located  in  the  city  of  Minneapolis,  Minn.  According  to  the  act 
of  the  second  territorial  Legislative  Assembly,  passed  by  the  efforts  of 
Hon.  J.  W.  North,  approved  and  signed  by  Gov.  Ramsey,  February  25, 
1851,  which  is  the  real  beginning  of  the  legal  existence  of  the  Institu- 
tion, the  location  of  the  University  was  designated  as  "at  or  near  the 
Falls  of  St.  Anthony" — the  modern  equivalent  of  this  being  Minne- 
apolis. 

Minnesota  had  become  a  Territory  In  1849,  and  was  admitted  into  the 
Union  as  a  State  in  1858.  The  University  was  subjected  by  the  several 
legislatures  to  various  reorganizations,  viz.,  in  1860  and  in  1864,  but  it 
was  not  until  the  Act  of  1868,  by  which  a  complete  reorganization  was 
effected,  that  the  present  charter  of  the  University  was  obtained.  The 
planning  of  real  college  work  dates  from  that  time.  The  following  col- 
leges were  included  in  the  plan  of  organization,  viz.,  Science,  Literature 
and  Arts;  Engineering,  Metallurgy  and  the  Mechanic  Arts;  Dept.  of 
Law;  Dept.  of  Medicine;  and  also  a  college  of  Agriculture,  with  the 
University  experimental  farm  only  a  few  miles  away. 

The  year  1869,  September  15,  marked  the  organization  of  the  Uni- 
versity proper,  the  election  of  William  W.  Folwell  as  president,  and  the 
beginning  of  University  instruction.  President  Folwell  resigned  in 
1883,  to  take  the  chair  of  Political  Science,  and  Dr.  Cyrus  Northrop, 
Professor  of  English  Literature  at  Yale,  was  chosen  as  his  successor. 
In  1883  there  were  about  three  hundred  students  in  attendance;  now  the 
registration  exceeds  three  thousand,  two  hundred  students  taking  post- 
graduate work,  of  whom  about  forty  are  candidates  for  the  degree  of 
Ph.  D.,  and  about  fifteen  for  the  degree  of  D.  C.  L. 

In  athletics  the  University  of  Minnesota  has  occupied  a  very  import- 
ant position  in  the  West,  and  to  Minnesota  is  largely  due  the  develop- 
ment of  Western  football,  the  event  of  greatest  interest  being  the  annual 
Wisconsin-Minnesota  game. 

The  University  of  Minnesota  is  a  young  but  vigorous  and  flourishing 
institution,  with  bright  prospects  for  the  future,  and  every  true  Zete  will 
share  with  the  Alpha  Betas  a  feeling  of  pride  in  the  addition  of  the 
University  of  Minnesota  to  the  chapter  roll  of  Zeta  Psi. 

The  Alpha  Beta  Chapter  of  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity  was  founded  on 
August  26,  1899,  but  in  reality  it  has  a  history  antedating  that  event  by 
several  years.  During  the  fall  of  1892  Thomas  Devereux,  with  other 
members  of  the  Sophomore  class  of  the  University  of  Minnesota,  among 
them  Norman  B.  Atty,  conceived  the  idea  of  forming  at  the  University  a 
local  social  organization  which  should  subsequently  petition  for  a  charter 
from  some  one  of  the  leading  Greek  letter  college  fraternities.  At  the 
same  time  several  other  students,  among  whom  was  the  writer,  had 
formed  a  secret  society  much  on  the  order  of  a  local  college  fraternity, 
with  aims  and  purposes  entirely  similar  to  those  outlined  by  their  con- 
temporaries above  referred  to.  Both  of  these  prospective  societies  were 
entirely  ignorant  of  each  other's  existence  until  the  week  of  Commence- 
ment, in  June,  1893,  when  Thomas  Devereux  and  C.  O.  Alexius  Olson 
approached  one  another  for  the  purpose  of  soliciting  each  other's  member- 
ship in  the  respective  societies.  This  led  to  a  conference  meeting  which 
resulted  in  a  happy  union  of  the  two  bodies  and  an  organization  which  for 
three  years  was  known  as  the  'Varsity  Club  (V.  C. ).  A  Constitution 
was  drawn  up  and  signed  by  the  members,  and  immediately  the  V.  C.  's 
set  out  to  determine  which  college  fraternity  to  petition  for  a  charter. 
After  making  a  careful  study  of  all  the  better  fraternities  not  represented  at 
Minnesota,  and  with  the  additional  information  obtained  from  Bro.  Theo- 


888  ALPHA  BETA  CHAPTER 

dore  Wetmore,  W  '77,  whose  acquaintance  several  of  the  members  had  for- 
tunately made,  in  regard  to  the  existing  conditions,  social  standing, 
lofty  purposes  and  high  ideals  of  Zeta  Psi,  it  was  the  unanimous  vote  of 
the  'Varsity  Club  to  petition  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity  of  North  America, 
at  its  next  annual  Convention,  for  the  establishment  of  a  chapter  at  the 
University  of  Minnesota.  And  the  history  of  the  'Varsity  Club  and  its 
successor,  the  Kappa  Phi  Upsilon,  for  the  next  six  years,  aside  from  its 
local  affairs  and  rapid  recognition  at  the  University  in  all  student 
affairs,  social  and  political,  is  a  history  of  the  repeated  petitions  to  the 
Zeta  Psi  Fraternity  for  a  charter. 

The  V.  C.  immediately  petitioned  the  next  Grand  Chapter  Conven- 
tion (1894),  and  at  the  meeting  thereof  a  letter  from  Bro.  Theodore  Wet- 
more,  W  '77,  was  read  favoring  the  petitioners,  but  as  the  petition  was 
not  in  the  proper  form  no  action  could  be  taken  by  the  Convention.  The 
petitioners  having  prior  to  this  time  become  fully  aware  of  the  conserva- 
tism of  the  fraternity,  came  to  realize  that  the  securing  of  a  charter 
would  require  time,  and  set  about  the  work  of  strengthening  the  local  or- 
ganization. The  '  Varsity  Club  continued  to  prosper ;  was  well  represented 
on  the  musical  clubs;  had  some  of  the  highest  offices  in  the  Cadet  Corps; 
held  the  presidency  of  the  Senior  Class  and  was  represented  on  the  Ariel. 
All  the  Zetes  in  the  Twin  Cities  were  interviewed,  and  correspondence 
was  carried  on  with  those  throughout  the  State  relative  to  the  matter  of 
petitioning,  and  as  a  body  the  Zeta  Psi  Alumni  of  the  State  were  now 
heartily  in  favor  of  the  project,  Bro.  Theodore  Wetmore,  W  '77,  laboring 
continually  in  our  behalf,  as  well  as  Bros.  John  Day  Smith,  X  '72,  Dr. 
H.  L.  Staples,  A  '81,  Dr.  Charles  M.  Jordan,  K'77,  Arthur  M.  Wickwire, 
Z  '90,  Fred  N.  Van  Duzee,  Z  '87,  Edward  Dyer,  Z  '91,  Frank  H.  Griggs, 
Z  '93,  and  others.  Originally  the  policy  of  the  V.  C.  had  been  to  keep  its 
existence  a  secret,  but  by  this  time  not  only  its  existence,  but  its  purpose, 
were  well  known,  and  henceforth  the  'Varsity  Club  rented  rooms  and  was 
thereafter  recognized  as  a  local  fraternity.  In  1895  the  Grand  Chapter 
was  again  duly  petitioned  through  the  Psi  Chapter,  Bro.  John  Day 
Smith,  X  '72,  being  present  in  behalf  of  the  petitioners,  but  without  suc- 
cess. At  the  Convention  in  1896  Bro.  Fred  N.  Van  Duzee,  Z  '87,  was 
present  in  behalf  of  the  petition,  but  it  was  again  denied.  This  resulted 
only  in  more  determined  efforts  on  the  part  of  the  petitioners  for  Zeta  Psi 
at  Minnesota,  and  a  reorganization  was  effected  with  a  view  of  further 
insuring  the  perpetuation  of  its  existence  at  the  University. 

In  1897  there  was  no  petition  before  the  Convention,  but  a  new  one 
was  being  prepared  by  the  K  $  2",  which  was  organized  as  successor  to 
the  'Varsity  Club  as  a  Greek  letter  fraternity  not  only  in  spirit,  but 
in  name,  the  badge  of  the  society  being  an  elongated  shield,  bearing  the 
letters  K  $  1C  on  a  field  of  black  enamel,  with  the  skull  and  bones 
underneath.  In  1898  the  new  petition  of  the  K  £  T  was  duly  presented  to  the 
Convention  at  Easton,  C.  E.  Payson  Colwell,  a  member  of  the  K  $  T 
(who  died  at  Manila  while  a  member  of  the  13th  Reg't,  Minn.  Vols.),  rep- 
resenting the  petitioners.  He  brought  back  the  happy  news  that  the 
charter  had  been  granted.  During  that  year,  through  the  assistance  of 
the  localZeta  Psi  Alumni,  and  in  particular  Bros.  Gustave  Scholle,  H  '83, 
past  2  A;  Theodore  Wetmore,  W  '77,  H.  L.  Staples,  A  '81,  and  Philip 
B.  Hunt,  K  '92,  negotiations  were  made  for  the  purchase  of  a  very  desir- 
able house,  suitably  arranged  and  conveniently  located  for  a  chapter 
house  (on  the  corner  of  Harvard  and  Beacon  Streets,  S.  E.),  being  but  a 
short  distance  from  the  University. 

At  the  Montreal  Convention,  in  1899,  Bros.  Gustave  Scholle,  U  '83, 
past  2  A;  Theodore  Wetmore,  W  '77,  and  William  L.  Brown  (of  the  K  $ 
T),  on  behalf  of  the  petitioners,  reported  that  all  the  required  conditions 
had  been  met.  The  incoming  Grand  Officers,  together  with  such 
Brothers  as  they  should  designate,  were  appointed  to  install  the  chapter 
as  soon  as  details  could  be  arranged.  Accordingly,  on  Saturday, 
August  26,  1899,  the  installation  of  the  chapter  of  the  Zeta  Psi  Fraternity

at  the  University  of  Minnesota  took  place  at  the  residence  of  Bro.  Theo-

McGill  University,  '87,  $  A;  Pomeroy  Ladue  (3),  University  of  Michi-

Israel  C.  Pierson  (#),  New  York  University,  '65,  J  A.  Assisting-  the 
Grand  Officers  in  the  work  of  initiation  were  Bros.  Gustave  Scholle,  II  '83, 
past  2  A-,  Theodore  Wetmore,  W  '77,  H.  L.  Staples,  A  '81,  Philip  B.

The  following,  members  of  the  Kappa  Phi  Upsilon  and  students  of 
the  University  of  Minnesota,  after  being  examined  by  the  Grand  Officers, 
were  duly  initiated  as  the  charter  members  of  the  Alpha  Beta  Chapter

man Belmont  Atty,  and  installed  by  the  Grand  Officers.  The  Charter 
Banquet  was  held  at  the  West  Hotel,  Minneapolis,  Minn.,  August26, 1899. 

Immediately  upon  the  opening  of  the  new  college  year  the  Alpha 
Betas  moved  into  their  new  home  at  200  Harvard  Street,  S.  E.,  Minne- 
apolis, Minn.  Our  home  is  a  commodious  and  not  an  unattractive  frame 
building,  well  adapted  to  our  purposes,  and  conveniently  situated  with 
reference  to  the  University.  The  first  initiation  was  held  on  November 
10  and  11,  1899,  at  which  time  seven  of  the  most  desirable  men  at  the  Uni- 
versity were  added  to  Alpha  Beta  and  to  Zeta  Psi.  On  that  occasion  Bro. 
Edgar  Rozier,  W  '98,  of  St.  Louis,  was  a  guest,  and  rendered  much 
valuable  assistance.  The  Alpha  Beta  being  as  yet  in  its  very  infancy, 
has  no  great  achievements  of  which  to  speak,  save  that  we  are  Zetes,  for- 
ever loyal  in  the  bonds  of  T  K  $.
